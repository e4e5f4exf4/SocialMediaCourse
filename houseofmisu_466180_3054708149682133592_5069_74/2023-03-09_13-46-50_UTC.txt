The day I left home for Paris was the day I experienced the most intense attack of anxiety. A mums intuition is a magical thing because two days prior to my travels, mum called me and told me she would be coming along. 
It changed everything. 
Early in the trip, she told me a story about being turned away from the restaurant on the top of the Eiffel Tower when she came to Paris 40 years ago because she didn’t have a reservation. 
So I took her to lunch to @madamebrasserietoureiffel on top the Eiffel Tower… a mother daughter date. 

Thank you for knowing just what I need when I need it Mummy. #mummyandmi #paris #misuinparis #madamebrasserie #explorefrance #madamebrasserietoureiffel @explorefrance
