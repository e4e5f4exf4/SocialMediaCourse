I’ve had a lot of people ask about Gaslighting after I shared a few posts about Narcissism.

So after years of experiencing this and also coaching people through the process of identifying it and healing from it, this is gaslighting in a nutshell…

Gaslighting is when someone often tries to manipulate you and make you doubt your own perception of reality.

The gaslighter tries to control you and make you feel powerless, which can be really confusing and upsetting.

The person who is gaslighting you may have gone through some tough stuff in their own life. 

Maybe they were hurt, neglected or abused when they were younger, and that pain is still with them.

But instead of dealing with it, they take it out on others.

It's not your job to fix their problems, but it might help you understand that they are hurting too. 

That doesn't excuse their behavior, but it might help you feel less angry or ashamed.

You can still protect yourself, set boundaries and find support to heal from the gaslighting.

None of us are perfect and we all slip into a form of gaslighting at some point in our life but when it is not attended to or is a constant go-to tactic in relationship it can be extremely selfish and manipulative.

Remember, you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. You have the right to trust your own experiences and feelings.

Don't let the gaslighter dim your light or make you feel crazy. You are not alone, and you can heal from this.

Have you experienced gaslighting from someone close to you?

If so what did you do to communicate to the person and/or heal from the after effects of it?
