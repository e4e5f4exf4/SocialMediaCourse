When you hear ‚ÄúAppalachia,‚Äù what comes to mind? Community advocate Lora Smith sees ancient mountains and lush forests that provide the backbone of the 13-state region; an amalgam of bustling cities and rural hollers, with a globally connected economy pulsing at its center since colonization. What makes the food so distinct can be found in the people who love and fight for this complex place. In this package, you'll find recipes, personal essays, and travel guides that represent the glorious and delicious range this region offers.

At the link in bio, there are recipes for @silveriocovozzi8's Pork Shoulder Inasal, @crystalwilki's Peppery Chicken and Dumplings, @dash37board37's Spring Greens With Hot Bacon Vinaigrette, and @lisamariedonovan's Appalachian Apple Stack Cake. Plus, road trip itineraries to Pittsburgh, West Virginia, and East Tennessee's must-eat pit stops and restaurants. A report by Rebecca Nagle (@rebeccanagle) about Cherokee chef @elisi_oklahoma, whose food reveals how Appalachian cooking traditions found their way to Oklahoma. And last but not least, heartfelt writing by @annette_saunooke_clapsaddle, @lisamariedonovan, and Rick Bragg about the personal histories behind Appalachian food like dried apples and biscuits. üì∏ Photography: @cahlinetompkins
