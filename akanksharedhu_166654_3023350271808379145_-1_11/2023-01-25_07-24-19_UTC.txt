Being the salad lover ü•ó that I am I was muy excited to lunch at @uncafesalad recently ‚ú®
Love the max natural light coming in, the cute cosy interiors, the location of the restaurant (it's a great spot to sit read, have your coffee and people watch all day) and the FOOD!
Fresh, local ingredients to make the loveliest salad bowls that you can even build on your own from everything available on the menu.
Here's what we had and loved:
~ Build your own bowl: mine had butternut squash, avocado, feta, sun-dried tomatoes, cottage cheese and a bunch of other stuff.
~ Scrambled eggs on an open faced sandwich
~ Hot chocolate (highly recommend for those who consume dairy, it was YUM)
~ Pumpkin soup
Everything was fresh, light, yum and just as it should be ü§åü§å‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
