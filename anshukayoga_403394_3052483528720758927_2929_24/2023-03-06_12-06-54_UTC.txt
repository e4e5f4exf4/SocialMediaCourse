A blissful day spent in the City of Lakes - Udaipur 💙

My first pit stop had to be at @vipulshahbags studio at @ganeshemporium which is situated in a beautiful 17th century haveli and is definitely one of the most beautiful stores I’ve been too. 

And then we went to the #SoulFestival2023 @theanataudaipur to attend the sufi night with @harshdeepkaurmusic 🤍
