What a win from our women's team against Pakistan in a high pressure game and a tough run chase. The women’s team is taking such giant leaps ahead with every tournament we play and it’s going to inspire a whole generation of girls to take up the sport and take women’s cricket higher and higher. More power to all of you. God bless.
