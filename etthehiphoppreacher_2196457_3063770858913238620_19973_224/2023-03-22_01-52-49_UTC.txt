If you want to achieve those big dreams, you gotta be willing to put in the work. You gotta wake up early and stay up late. You gotta hustle harder and smarter than everyone else. It won't be easy, but it will be worth it!

Now, some of y'all might be thinking, "ET, I'm only 70% there. That's not enough to make it happen." But let me tell you, that 70% is all you need to get started. That 70% is the foundation for the other 30% to build on. And trust me, when you keep putting in that effort, that 30% will come. It's just a matter of time.

But here's the thing, fam. If you're one of those people who only puts in 10% or 20%, you'll never see your dreams come true. You'll always be stuck wondering what could have been. But not you! You're the one who's gonna put in that 70%. You're the one who's gonna chase those dreams until you catch them!

What percentage are you?
