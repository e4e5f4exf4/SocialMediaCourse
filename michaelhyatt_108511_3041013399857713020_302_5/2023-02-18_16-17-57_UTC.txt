“Over the last year, I have read a lot of Michael Hyatt’s books. Mind Your Mindset is by far the one that has sparked a new conversation I want to have with myself. About halfway through part 2, I realized that I have several stories I have been holding onto and will follow the process to re-write them and develop a new Narrator. Similar to Megan’s story about the fear of public speaking, mine is more about speaking up in meetings because no one will ever take me seriously, so I never bother. Just applying the first step, I realized that is not even supported with the data I have. Which prompted me to dig deeper into all the other stories I kept telling myself. Needless to say, if you ever wanted to break a cycle that you are in, reading this book will force you to confront those stories and make you ask if they are true.⁠
⁠
I cannot express how much I appreciate Michael and Megan for sharing their stories and research throughout this book.⁠
⁠
If you are looking to make a meaningful change in 2023, read this book and do the work. You may just find the breakthrough you need to make your dreams or goals possible. Thank you, Michael and Megan.” ⁠
