Yoga props aid the body to flow into Yoga poses with more ease and also help to:
-Improve balance and flexibility to perform asanas 
-Increase the range of motion of our body muscles.
-Stretch deeper into Yoga poses

They are especially very useful for beginners to improve their overall coordination and alignment.

Let these props come to your rescue when you need that extra assistance for your Yoga practice🙌🏻
