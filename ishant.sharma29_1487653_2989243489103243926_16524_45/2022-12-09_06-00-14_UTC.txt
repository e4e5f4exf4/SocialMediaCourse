It’s been such a beautiful journey with you, my love. I have a companion, a best friend, and most importantly a person who I can always trust. How life brought us together and how we are still nailing it being with each other through thick and thin. Love, I never knew I would take any decision in my life by myself until I met you because you always pushed me to do things my way and Thank You for doing so!! You made me a person who is independent on and that’s how you created your Genie ❤️❤️ I love doing things for you and frankly that’s the only thing that keeps me motivated to do something in life 🤷‍♀️ So keep asking for more my love, I am always and always there to fulfil your desires ❤️ @ishant.sharma29 🥂❤️
