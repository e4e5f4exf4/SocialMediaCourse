Happy #InternationalWomensDay 
To the one responsible for me being here on this planet. 

My mother,
Thank you for not allowing the messed up, rock-bottom, drugged-up version of me into your life. 

The moment you decided that you would no longer tolerate me near,  if I continued the path I was on, a defining moment in my life. 

I expect you'd be proud of the man I am today- you saw more in me than I saw in myself.  You're are the reason I made the pivot 

Hope you're watching from above and smiling down on me.  Every time I think of you, almost daily, I am reminded of how strong & resilient women are, how influential you are all are to the future of the world.  Thanks for being a great woman in my life.
