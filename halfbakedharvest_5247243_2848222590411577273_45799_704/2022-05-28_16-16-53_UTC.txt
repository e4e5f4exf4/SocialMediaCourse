Strawberry Mojito üçì you can never go wrong with mojitos. I do mine up for summer with muddled strawberries, lime, mint, a double shot of rum + ginger beer for a spicy/sweet kick. the sweet lime-sugar-rimmed glass seals the deal. linked in profile. ps. officially doing a summer cocktail Saturday series. what new drinks do we want to see?
