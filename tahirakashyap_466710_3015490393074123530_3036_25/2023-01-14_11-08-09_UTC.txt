When it comes to travelling, Tahira Kashyap Khurrana (@tahirakashyap ) leaves no stone unturned. But for the writer-director, one destination calls for multiple visits. She says, 

"The amazing islands of the Bahamas, its weather, the Carribean climate, the mesmersing turquoise waters...you can't get enough! Whether it is the rich history of pirates, swimming with pigs (apart from eating like one!), lazing around in beaches, it is definitely an offbeat place that I can visit again!"
