Photo dump from my day spent with mum at @printemps in Paris last week. 
I’m not much of a department store kind of shopper , always preferring the charming stand alone stores, off the beaten path. 
But Printemps has a certain je ne sais quoi which you need to see to believe. Aside from the stunning interiors and beautiful curation , they have an entire floor dedicated to vintage finds including hard to get Hermes bags and fine jewellery. They also have a space dedicated to last seasons hot pieces sold at reduced prices. If that’s not enough to sway you , they have a great personal shopper service and if you can’t make it to the store , they have an entire set up to help make your online shopping experience personalised and seem less. 
Wow, I just realised I literally went on a rant but I truly was very impressed. 
Thank you for showing me around and I will be back. @explorefrance #NOTanAD #paris #parisshopping #followmitoparis #misuinparis #mummyandmi #explorefrance #printempshaussmann #printemps
