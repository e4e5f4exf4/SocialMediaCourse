So much joy speaking in Lisbon, Portugal at the amazing @susanatorresoficial event. What’s so very special about this event - other than the fire! - is that Susana is one for our high performance students who is now a true leader in Europe bringing excellence in high performance coaching and personal development to everyone. It was full circle moment to speak on her event after she attended mine so many years ago as a beginner, and I will have her on my stage to complete the circle. She’s an incredible mother, leader and friend who is showing what’s possible with real vision to be the best and to work hard and persevere and serve. I love how her whole family is involved in making major events like this happen - it feels very special. She also has the worlds best involved like the world football (soccer) champion @gilbertosilva who is an incredible inspiration. Thank you Portugal for the amazing welcome and experience. 🇵🇹❤️
