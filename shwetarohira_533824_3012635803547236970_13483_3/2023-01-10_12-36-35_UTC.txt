Me No Pause Me play by Manoj Kumar Sharma 

I highly recommend this book to all. It’s a book that I would ask All you to read from Men to Women. It’s a game changer for the society if all us resonate with it which I am sure you will. You know it’s a book which highlights a very strong message which actually we all take very lightly in our lives. If you see the Title without without space you will realise what the story is all about ME NO PAUSE —— Menopause. Yes it’s about it that all we women go through but along with us even our families are a part Because the change is not just in the hormones there is a change physically as well as emotionally. It’s a short book with deep message for everyone out there. It’s like perfect to the T as it explains the entire journey of a women in all spheres of her life. He has touched all the challenges she faces from biological to emotional. The author has put across with utmost simplicity. Also the characters are just three and each of them are so extremely well crafted that you feel you know each of them. Also the way the story culminates and it ends keeps you in positive spirits. It’s a soulful read 
Happy Reading Bookstagrammers
