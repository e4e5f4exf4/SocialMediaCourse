Think of @zaynab_issa’s Creamy Preserved 🍋 Dressing as a citrusy take on classic blue cheese dressing. Finely chopped preserved lemon steps in for the cheese, bringing its own salty complexity to a recipe that’s an ideal match for crisp iceberg wedges, colorful crudités, spicy Buffalo wings, or crispy wavy potato chips.
