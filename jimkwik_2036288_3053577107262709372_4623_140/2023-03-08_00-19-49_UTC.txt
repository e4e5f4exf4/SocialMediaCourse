You have an incredible gift between your ears, but it doesn't come with an owner's manual. 🧠⁠
⁠
Knowing how to use your whole brain isn't something you're taught or necessarily know how to do in school or anywhere. 💡⁠
⁠
If you haven’t listened to our podcast episode 231: The Secret to Using Your Whole Brain with Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor (less than 20 mins), I highly recommend you do so. 💡⁠
⁠
If her name sounds familiar, it's likely because you watched her TEDtalk or read her memoir, My Stroke of Insight, which we've included on our recommended book list for many years now.⁠
⁠
In this episode we’ve discussed her newest book, Whole Brain Living: The Anatomy of Choice and the Four Characters That Drive Our Lives. This book is a myth-buster in so many ways. ⚡️⁠
⁠
Listen in as Dr. Jill discusses the myths of the brain and goes into the mechanics of getting your brain to work for you. If you've ever wondered what the secret for making good choices in your life is so that you can live the life you deserve and desire, this episode is for you. 💚⁠
