I have devastating news. Dave Hollis passed away this weekend. A statement was posted online by his parents:

"Dave Hollis, former President of Worldwide Distribution at Disney, passed away peacefully at his home outside Austin, TX on Saturday night. Though exact cause of death has yet to be determined, his family confirms he had been hospitalized recently for some heart issues. He was 47.” 

Dave was a good man, a loving father, an inspiring teacher, and a dear friend. 

We spent a lot of time together. I loved his caring and empathy, his energy and enthusiasm, his vulnerability in sharing his struggles, and his love of his children and helping people. 

We taught for a year together and the depth of his sharing and wisdom had me and our audience in tears so many times.

I loved our funny conversations, how he taught, how many great laughs and grand plans we shared. 

We were just together last month with friends when he was hospitalized with heart-related issues. He was released okay and I got to share with him then our love for him then, as did our friends. He knew he was loved. 
It sounds like those heart health issues continued. 

We are sending our love, prayers and condolences to his family and all our shared friends and communities saddened by this news today. 

It feels unreal- Tomorrow would have been Dave's birthday. 

Please pray for his family and give them space and prayer. 

I will miss you my brother. 
Rest In Peace dear friend.
🙏❤️
