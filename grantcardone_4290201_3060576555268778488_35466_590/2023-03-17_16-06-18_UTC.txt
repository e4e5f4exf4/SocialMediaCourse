I don’t consider myself lucky. I consider luck a byproduct of all the massive action I’ve taken in every single area of my life.

Especially in my marriage.

If I didn’t have persistence I wouldn’t be married to the woman of my dreams.

I’ve said it many times before, and so has she- she didn’t want anything to do with me when she first met me. She hated me.

Fast forward almost 2 decades and 2 kids later... we’re still standing strong.

Before I ever met Elena, I knew the type of wife I wanted but more importantly, I knew how committed I wanted to be to her. When I commit, I go all in. She was no exception. If anything, she was the rule.

I look back at the day when we got married, July 4, 2004, and I’m beyond grateful.

The reason for the legacy I’ll leave behind starts with my wife.

In life, you need a partner that will not only push you past your limits but will tell you the truth, no matter how harsh. You need a partner who aligns with your purpose and works at it with you every single day. We’re not perfect, but we know exactly what’s needed to make a marriage successful.

To celebrate our upcoming anniversary, we’re doing a Couples Retreat where you can join us with your partner and other 10X couples on April 15-16 in Los Cabos, Mexico.
