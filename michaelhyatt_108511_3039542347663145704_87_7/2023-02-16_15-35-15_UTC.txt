The problem is that we sometimes get lost in the subjective side—our own thoughts, hunches, and hypotheses. When we do, we’re liable to make connections that aren’t really there. We make logical leaps in the way we connect the dots of our story.⁠
⁠
One such error occurs when we allow our goals to shape our stories. When we are focused on a particular outcome, we may miss key information that would change the story. Researchers call this cognitive bias.⁠
