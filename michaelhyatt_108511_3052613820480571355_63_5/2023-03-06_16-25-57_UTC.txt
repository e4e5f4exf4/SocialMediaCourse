Here's the difference between a goal and a wish. A wish is a vague aspiration like “get healthy” or “make more money” or “fall in love.” A goal, on the other hand, is a specific, actionable intention. It’s something you can do. ⁠
⁠
A study out of Duke University found that people with more specific goals gained more momentum and grew in motivation as they progressed, while people with less specific goals had the opposite tendency. They lost steam along the way and reported a decline in motivation, even when they made some progress. ⁠
⁠
So the trick is to sharpen your expectations into specific goals that you can do something about.⁠
