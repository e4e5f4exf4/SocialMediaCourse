Back at one of my faves - @bougiedelhi to try out their fresh new menu. Sigh. So much pretty, even more tasty 🐒
My faves were (in order shown): Avocado 🥑 tartare (so fresh, so light, melt-in-mouth), Chicken satay (juicy, perfect and frankly the best satay I've had in a while), pork belly and the caramel-hazelnut sourdough French Toast, most of which i inhaled single handedly 🐐
Not sure why i tried to fit that pose in the last slide because my belly was bursting at the end but well here we all are :)
