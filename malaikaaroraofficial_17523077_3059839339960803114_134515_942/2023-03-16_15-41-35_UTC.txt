When you love looking good, the world finds something bad to add to it. They tagged me as “High Maintenance”. But I do me, unapologetically with @LakmeIndia, who has redefined the so-called “tags” women carry, at this Lakmé Fashion Week.

I now wear my tag of “High Maintenance” with bold makeup. What about you?
