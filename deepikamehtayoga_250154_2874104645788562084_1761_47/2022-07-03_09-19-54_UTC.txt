Smoothie time in Mi Casa🏕🌺🥬🥑🍌🍇💃🏻
.
I’ve been off my inspired self for a while, but the last few days I got a strong message from the Universe and  via some incredible friends to get back on track .
So I’ve gotten back with all the practices that really bring me joy to bring in the energy of creativity , abundance and all the juiciness I’ve missed ..
.
One of the things that always brings me joy besides yoga and meditation is making my own vibrant food . So here goes my recipe for today:
.
Alchemy Smoothie:
•Handful organic kale/ spinach 
•mixed berries 
•frozen medium banana 
•250 ml cashew milk 
•scoop of Vegan protein (I use @sunwarrior collagen peptides tathitian vanilla )
•1/2 teaspoon maca (amazing for hormones and is an incredible adaptogen ) 
Blend up in a high powered blender .
Top up with dried berries , bee pollen and any yummy things you like to add colour and vibrancy.
The secret ingredient though is adding the best intention and gratitude to your food.That is where the true alchemy lies.💫✨🔱❤️🍇🦋
