Detroit Style Tomato Herb Pepperoni Pizza. there might not be a better pizza. itâ€™s all about the crispy cheese crust surrounding the entire pan style pizza. the crust + all the melty cheese and pepperoni too?! holy freaking yummm. the herbs/garlic only add to the deliciousness. recipe linked in profile. get at it this weekend (:
