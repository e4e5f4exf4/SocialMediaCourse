The Cursed Gem - Ashwini Malhotra 

The books is a sequel to a series but trust me it’s still a stand alone. It can be read independently and you will still not be clueless at any point. The title intrigued me from the first past itself and since I have read part one I was quite serious to know what’s in store in the second part. The Cursed Gem part 2 is when the lord of the past The Maharathi Ashwatthama reappears for the cursed gen and the wars between the kingdoms for two reasons to conquer and the old mystic weapon Divya Astra which is with Ujjayini Kingdom and also wanting to bring the fiend all to the glory of Ujjayni kingdom. All the characters and the plots are very well crafted. The story progresses flawlessly and smoothly inspite of so many characters. The writing and narration style of author makes the book very visualistic. The author through the stories and learning’s that he shares between the characters makes the narrative more engaging. Mythological fiction is a trend and there are numerous books out there but still this books is a fresher and ends with a cliffhanger leaving you for wanting more
