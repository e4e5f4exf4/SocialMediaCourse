LOVE is the ultimate advantage. No kidding…

People ask me all the time about all the *external* results and successes of my career over last 20 years…

They think it’s business, marketing, sales, content, network, background, connections, etc. they see the numbers and fans and hear about the businesses and clients and bestsellers. 

But the through line is simple:

I love people. 

I have a real and cultivated spiritual understanding and care for people. 

I put love in my heart, even when I have reason to be angry.

I know you want love, understanding, belonging, care, appreciation, respect, support — deep down it’s always there. For me too. 

Give and you shall receive. 

Project love. 
Protect love. 
Give love. 

It’s your superpower. Sure is mine. 

Hey - love you today!
Your coach,
Brendon.
