Swipe to see 7 questions that can help you assess the logic of your own story or of someone else’s. ⁠
⁠
A logical leap can be made when we subconsciously seek or give more weight to evidence that supports our own conclusions. Researchers call this confirmation bias. It’s always a temptation to favor any data that affirms our previously drawn conclusions and discount the rest.⁠
⁠
One of the ways you can interrogate a story is to ask someone else to examine it.⁠
⁠
By explaining to someone else why you believe what you do, you move from subjective to objective. You have to demonstrate how you drew your conclusion. As an added value, you’ll also gain a better understanding of your own story. Explaining your view to others will force you to think through it in ways you wouldn’t on your own. Your brain will make logical leaps and accept incongruities that others might not. What’s obvious to you probably won’t be to them and vice versa. ⁠
