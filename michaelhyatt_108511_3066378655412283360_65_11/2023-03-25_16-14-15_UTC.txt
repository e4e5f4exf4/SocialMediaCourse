What we don’t know about a problem can be just as important as what we do. Our brain is constantly at work connecting the dots of our experience. To make meaning quickly, it fills in blanks and leaves stuff out. We think we know X causes Y, but it turns out that X + A causes Y.⁠

Whatever the story in our head, it’s important to ask: Can we really know this based on the evidence we have? This query forces attention on our connections and conclusions. Does a particular story hold water, or is it full of holes?⁠
