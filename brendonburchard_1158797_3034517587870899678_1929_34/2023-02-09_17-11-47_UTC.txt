It’s hard to say, but many people don’t know just how much they act from BITTERNESS. 

They may have been justified in feeling upset at one point, no doubt. 

Life is unfair and it hurts and truly awful things happen. 

But sometimes we don’t release that over time and bitterness creeps in. 

Soon, there is a “bite” to our communication and actions. 

Few realize this. 

But when they finally SEE IT and become self-aware…

If they can not shame themselves for it but just recognize it and choose to do the hard work of personal development… it’s a huge huge breakthrough. Because we all want to let go and find peace and joy and trust and vibrancy again. Just takes growth work. 

My podcast is called Motivation with Brendon Burchard but don’t think we don’t take on the tough stuff too. 

Cheering you on today. Your coach,
Brendon.
