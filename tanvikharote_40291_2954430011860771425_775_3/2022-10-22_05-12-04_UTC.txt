It was Indeed an Honour to be at Victorious School for the Young Entrepreneurs Fest. Thank You so much Mr & Mrs Ghosh the President and Vice President of the school for inviting me as the Chief Guest to inaugurate the event. It was truly an enthralling experience visiting various stalls put up by the students promoting their business ideas. I truly appreciate the vision of the school, through which they are empowering students to tap into their untapped potential, and are giving them opportunities to step into the world of entrepreneurship. To be an entrepreneur one needs to have at-least 10 possible moves for their business and ideas for execution, calculative mind, consistency and more over courage. And watching these kids carrying these core values with utmost confidence, truly inspired me and I was in an aww. Right from 5 to 18 years of age, so many young minds sharing their vision was indeed a treat to watch. Well success is not an event, itâ€™s a process. My best wishes to these students as they embark on the journey of becoming successful entrepreneurs in near future.
