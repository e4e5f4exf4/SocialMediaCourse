Had a powerful conversation with @davidjharrisjr today.

I have massive respect for him for not backing down and sharing the truth of the agenda that shadowed over us the last 3 years when most buried their heads in the sand.

Isn’t it crazy how so many so called “conspiracy theories” have come true lately!?

True bravery isn't found in the absence of fear, but rather in the face of it.

It's standing firm in your beliefs, even when it means standing alone, and weathering the storm of criticism and backlash.

To all those who refuse to be silenced, who speak unapologetically in the face of adversity and stand ground when arrows fly - your courage is an inspiration to us all.

Which conspiracy theories did you end up losing followers for speaking up about which is now a fact? 👇🏼
