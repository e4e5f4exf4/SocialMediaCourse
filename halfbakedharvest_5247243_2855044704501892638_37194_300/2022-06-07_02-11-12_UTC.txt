Pesto Chicken Saltimbocca with Burst Tomatoes and Burrata. you guys, this one is really good. the pesto makes all the difference hidden underneath crispy prosciutto + a parmesan breading. but the burrata and warm cherry tomatoes add sooo much deliciousness. all together itâ€™s just really good, simple summer food. shared the recipe today - link in profile.
