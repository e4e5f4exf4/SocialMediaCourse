These "melts" are essentially a mushroom croque monsieur -- here atop sourdough with a schmear of Dijon-rich bechamel, a great pile of sauteed mushrooms and cheese that melts over the top and onto the baking sheet, to be lifted off in crispy flakes. Paired with a bowl of soup on a rainy day, a salad on a sunny one, I say we go all in. // Mushroom Tartines on smittenkitchen.com or linked in profile. In more detail: Go to my profile.
