Do you ever feel like your mouth has a mind of its own? Sometimes we just say things out of habit. This is why it’s important to be intentionally aware and trace these thoughts back to their source. ⁠
⁠
Interrogate them, then reimagine how you would state a more positive story.⁠
⁠
Start small. Begin using “get to” rather than “have to,” for instance. This might require some practice and a little persistence. ⁠
⁠
For example, replace “I have to go to work.” with, “I get to go to work.”⁠
⁠
Give it a try and see if you notice the difference it makes in your attitude.⁠
