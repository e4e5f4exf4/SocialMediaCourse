Black Pepper Chicken and Bacon Quesadillas with Basil Ranch + avocado too. I used to
make quesadillas all the time but these are special. The homemade basil ranch is key, donâ€™t skip the honey mustard. The bacon + cheese + honey mustard combo always works. These are quick to throw together but so delicious. Shared on the site today!
