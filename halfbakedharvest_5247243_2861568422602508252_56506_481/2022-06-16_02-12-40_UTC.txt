Summer Chicken Chopped Salad with Hot Bacon Dressing. the salad is good with herb grilled chicken, roasted peppers, avocado, grilled corn, all the elements of summer (: but itâ€™s the dressing that is the real secret. little bit tangy, little bit salty, with a nice spice + lots of crispy bacon. everything together = best kind of salad. recipe linked in profile.
