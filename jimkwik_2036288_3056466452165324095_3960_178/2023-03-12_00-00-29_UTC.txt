Remember that self-love isn't just about pampering yourself; it's about being your own superhero and protecting your precious time and energy. 💚⁠
⁠
Setting healthy boundaries around your time, emotions, mental health, and space is crucial for achieving success and happiness. ✨⁠
⁠
Whenever I face a decision, I always ask myself whether it's a "heaven yes" or a "heaven no" (keeping it clean here). If it doesn't resonate with me 100%, I don't waste my energy on it. ⛔️⁠
⁠
You deserve to prioritize yourself and your needs, so don't be afraid to say no to things that don't serve you!⁠
⁠
