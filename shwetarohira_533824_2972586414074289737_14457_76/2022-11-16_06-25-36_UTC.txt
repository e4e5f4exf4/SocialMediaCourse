The Reunion by Anas Kamal @anaskamal567 

Do you believe in ghosts? Do you think some places are haunted ? Do you believe in super natural powers? 

The reading world is clearly clear about this book and the extent to which this novel will scare you Co relates directly to whether you believe in these events. However writer convinces you into this world with his simple narration style. The chapters are short and the twist and turns are in abundance. It’s a story of five friends Maya, Ravi, Riya, Shreya and Mayank who met for a reunion after ten long years. It a story of how their joyous moment turned out to be the worst nightmare. I can’t disclose more as I might land up giving spoilers so rather you’ll buy your spoiled and spook yourselves as once you begin to read the author traps you in his dark plot. I rate it high as a horror book it’s done it’s job amazingly well.
