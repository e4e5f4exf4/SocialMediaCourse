I didn’t know fancy people growing up. No one wealthy. No one with crazy Ivy League degrees. No famous people. No writers. No speakers. No CEOs. No sales leaders. No event planners. No HR people. No book agents. No videographers. No distributors. No one in the public eye. 

SO WHAT?

You have to architect your future. You build from nothing. You lay the bricks and you build a temple with your own thoughts and habits and choices day after day. You build the future you desire not wish what you had. 

Doesn’t mean it’s easy. It’s just required. 

Keep at it my friend. Keep adding value to others. Keeep serving. Keep believing and improving day by day. Keep treating others with kindness and respect. You’ll be surprised one day where it takes you. 

Your coach,
Brendon.
