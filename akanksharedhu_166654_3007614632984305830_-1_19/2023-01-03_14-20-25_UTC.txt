#MeInMirrors ~ if you pay attention you'll realise i wear pretty much the same shit everyday just mixed n matched differently barring a couple of pieces. Especially in the winters. Pick your winners for the season and stick with em is my policy.
Cleaning up pretty well when called for.
Last is an unedited selfie of me unhinged after waking up at 11am recently. I'm shifting things & energy in life/work (both are completely intertwined for me organically and i love it that way) and that has called for slowing down even more than what i was used to (I've always been a chiller for the most part). It's mostly a culmination of the last 2 years for me which feels like more of a life lived than the other 33 years in some ways and i hope to share it here when the time comes :)
Style, food and travel will always be a part of my life so that you'll always find in this space ðŸš€
