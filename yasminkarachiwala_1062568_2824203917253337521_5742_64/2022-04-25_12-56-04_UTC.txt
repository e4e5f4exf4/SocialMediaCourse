Being a fitness professional for over 3 decades Iâ€™ve been fortunate to interact with a fair share of amazing professionals in the health and fitness industry.

But this weekend at SONEVA was magical where the world of nutrition and mindbody blossomed to new highs with @poojamakhija @luke_coutinho @anshukayoga 
each of whom are pioneers in their field because of their passion and dedication not only towards their profession but towards creating and establishing a healthier world.

@sonushivdasani is the founder and designer of @discoversoneva and the person behind the outstanding Soneva Soul which was a creation of his personal experience with fighting and overcoming cancer and then integrating all the treatments and so much more into it. 

Our Talkers Table (to be revealed soon, stay tuned) is all of us sharing our zeal and experience of our respective fields and bonding over our common purpose of improving health for each and everyone around us. 

@parineetasethi the power house of @globalspa_mag not only organized this incredible Talkers Table but also managed to get the amazing @rohanshrestha to shoot a cover with us.

These 4 days of work, masti and laughter formed a bond between all of us that was possible only at magical Soneva!!
