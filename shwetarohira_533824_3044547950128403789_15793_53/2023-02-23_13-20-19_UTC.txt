The Legend of Bappa Rawal (phase one) Kalbhojaditya Rawal penned by @utkasrshsri 
It’s a very exciting read as it’s a historical fiction with a lot of mythological references which were exciting factor me as I love both the genres and it’s rare that they are clubbed together. It’s a book which completely absorbs you into its pages. The story is fascinating and authors narration style, character crafting and minute detailing makes you engrossed in the read. It’s a book that needs your 100 percent attention as there are lots of tales woven together along with the main tale of Bappa Raval’s ascent to the throne. Special claps for the author for his research as the book contains a lot of historical information which will excite the history enthusiast. The narrative style of the author takes you in the past of these historical figures, his descriptive style makes you feel you are in that era. The entire scene comes to life. The cliffhanger that the author leaves you at makes you want to read the other parts soon. I am impatiently waiting for the sequels to follow. I recommend this book as it’s entertaining and enlightening as it’s based on historical heroes who have been forgotten or we aren’t aware of them besides that has a lot of spiritual layering to it
