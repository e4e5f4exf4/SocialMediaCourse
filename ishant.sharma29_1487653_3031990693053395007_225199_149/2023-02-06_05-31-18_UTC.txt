Happy birthday my love @pratima0808 . Today we celebrate another year of your grace, beauty, and unwavering love for me. 🎉

And since I always knew you were old 🤣, I got you some anti-aging cream as a birthday gift. But let's be honest; it's a bit too late for that. 😜

But in all seriousness, Choosing you as my life partner was the best decision. You bring happiness, laughter, joy into my life.

Here's to another year of making memories & cherishing each other. And please, promise me you'll learn some new dance moves 🙏. Happy b’day again, my love. ❤️
