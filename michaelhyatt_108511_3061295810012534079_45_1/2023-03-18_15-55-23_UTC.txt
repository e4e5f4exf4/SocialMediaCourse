As business owners, the energy we bring to work fuels the business in three ways:⁠
⁠
👉Enthusiasm - When we’re full of enthusiasm, it’s infectious and sets the tone and pace for the company.⁠
👉Effort - Great leaders lead by example and expect the same from their team that they expect of themselves.⁠
👉Endurance - There will always be ups and downs. Your ability to stay positive and keep pushing forward despite obstacles is crucial.⁠
⁠
 But there’s a cost to this level of energy that can have unwanted consequences.⁠
⁠
We work with business owners, just like you, in dozens of industries that come to us on the bitter edge of burnout. You may be ready to walk away and do something else or you may be holding work and your home life together—even if just barely.⁠
⁠
