The art of learning (and life) is the art of attention - where your focus goes energy flows. ✨⁠
⁠
Attention exists to help you not only survive, but to thrive—if it’s trained.⁠
⁠
Does your mind get easily distracted? 🤯⁠
⁠
If you haven’t listened to our 🎧 podcast episode 316: How To Focus Your Distracted Mind with Adam Gazzaley (less than 19 mins), I highly recommend you do so. ⚡️ ⁠
⁠
Dr. Gazzaley is the David Dolby Distinguished Professor of Neurology, Physiology, and Psychiatry at UCSF. He’s the founder of Neuroscape, host of a national PBS show, and the co-author of The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World.⁠
⁠
It’s impossible to put all of your focus everywhere at the same time. That’s simply not how the brain works. 🧠⁠
⁠
But being able to ignore certain stimuli isn’t a process that comes naturally. You have to learn how to direct where your attention goes.⁠
⁠
If you’ve been struggling with how to concentrate, focus, and minimize distractions in your daily life, this episode is for you.⁠
