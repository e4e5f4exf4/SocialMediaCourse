I am a dreamer, you are my dream,
Everything is perfect and as real as it can seem. 
You’re always on my mind and in my heart,
You’ve been a part of me from the very start. 

You make me strong and ignite a fire,
You’re a dream I long and truly desire.
You are my dream, you’ve invaded my soul,
And I will not stop until I reach my goal.

I can visualise you and it makes me smile, 
I’ll make you a reality even if it takes a while. 
And as I sit here for now and simply day-dream,
You make life as perfect as it can seem.

What or who are you dreaming of today? ⭐️❤️
