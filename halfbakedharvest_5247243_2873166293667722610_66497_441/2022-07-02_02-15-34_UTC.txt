Homemade Strawberry Shortcake Ice Cream Bars. Our favorite childhood ice cream bar, made at home with 7 ingredients. Love having the stashed in the freezer. The creamy strawberry ice cream base is perfection, but the “shortcake” crumb coating seals the deal with a little added crunch. So darn good and fun 🍓 recipe linked in profile.
