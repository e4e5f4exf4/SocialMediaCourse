I always fancied myself a bit of a wander luster. I craved travel especially post partum when the circumstances of life kept me home bound. I missed the thrill of exploring unknown cities and revisiting known haunts abroad. My friends and family travelled for work and for pleasure while I watched from afar - with an ache in my heart. 

Iâ€™ve travelled a lot these past few months and learnt that sometimes we think we need something but in truth everything I need is right here in my arms. 
Nothing feels better than coming home to you @babykrispy. #babyandmi #babykrispy
