I WANNA BE HER!ðŸ’—

#GucciAttache, An Object of Desire. @gucci #gifted 
 
 A piece of contemporary design created from the awareness of a modern attitude and of the intentional revival of a historical object from the archive: Gucci Attache is a bag that reinterprets tradition and the system of House codes while transporting a silhouette, which draws from an intuition and an attitude of the 1970s, into the present through a narrative and gesturality outside the confines of gender, feminine or masculine.
