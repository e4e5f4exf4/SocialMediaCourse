When Will you Die? Jayanthi Sankar @jeyanthisankar28 

Right from the very beginning from the title itself the book had me. What an intriguing title it’s a short novella with small chapters which makes it a day or two to read. It was my first book of the year and I thoroughly enjoyed reading this piece of fiction penned by Jayanthi as the narration style is fresh and I also like the style of storytelling specially the format. There are many other quotes and sub plots that I loved in the story  that I am itching to tell you all but I shouldn’t land up giving you all spoilers. I rather have you’ll discover it but never the less let me tell you a little about the story Susan is a kid from Goa and she has found a pen pal from Singapore Suiyi who is of the same age and they share their emotion through their letters. ( It took me back in time when I had a pen pal from Nagpur and I enjoying writing my heart out to her) back to the story they both have turbulent personal lives and though both are in different places and have different journeys in life they are still very connected. The author through her story and characters portage strong human behaviours, emotions; she has laid out beautiful different complexities and challenges that each one of us face within our circle with our closed ones or with the ones in our surroundings.
I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoy fiction and emotions that feel inspired from real life events and are looking for a quick thrill read to start their reading challenge.
