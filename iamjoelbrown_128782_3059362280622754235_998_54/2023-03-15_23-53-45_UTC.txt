Even in my darkest moments of anxiety, I found comfort and strength in knowing that God had not given me a spirit of fear.

Through prayer and faith, I learned to trust in His love and provision, and found peace that transcends all understanding.

Whether you're a believer or not, know that you don't have to face anxiety alone.

God reminds us that we don’t need to control everything.

Stress is ‘Fear of Loss of Control’ and it is the reason why we stay on loop because we want certainty to feel safe.

But this is an illusion most of the time.

Call upon God in prayer to give you clarity and your steps will not be confusing but will be paced and more clear.

Take heart in the truth that God's love is available to all, and that He is always with you, ready to support and guide you through any struggle.

Have you ever experienced peace with God before?
