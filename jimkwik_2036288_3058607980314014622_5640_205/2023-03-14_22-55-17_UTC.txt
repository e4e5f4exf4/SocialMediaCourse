Who else thinks our words matter? 🙋⁠
⁠
Your brain is like a supercomputer and your self-talk is the program it will run. 🧠⁠
⁠
So if you tell yourself ‘I am not good at remembering names’, you will not remember the name of the next person you meet because you programmed your computer not to.⁠
⁠
Audit your inner voice and stand guard to the doors of your mind especially to the low opinions of others. ✨⁠
