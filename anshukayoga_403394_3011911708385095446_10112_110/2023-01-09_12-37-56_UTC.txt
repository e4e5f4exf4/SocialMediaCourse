Some journeys in life open a whole new world for you üíô

I was invited by the @isha.foundation and had the privilege to experience and learn their simple but effective way of living. 

I also had the chance to meet and interact with @sadhguru and it was definitely spiritually elevating for my soul and outlook towards life. 

I was definitely overwhelmed mesmerised by the magnanimous AdiYogi statue, the story the light show conveyed, meeting the students @ishahomeschool, meditating at the dhyanalinga, every little thing was just pure joy. 

Shared this experience not only with my mom, the other beautiful souls but also got lucky meeting one of my bestest @jaiswalpragya üñ§

PS: I couldn't have asked for a better beginning to my new year‚ù§Ô∏è
