As a Woman I am aware that we all have a deep sense of needing to be heard and seen ..this is not the same as external validation but a deeper sense of having a space of presence to be able to speak your truth and be seen for who you really are , beyond the roles of mother, wife, partner, daughter ..
This space can be held by a group of like minded women/ a circle of trust but in the case where some of us are not fortunate enough to have that , we need to be the ones to “listen “ and “see” our own selves ..to create a deeper space of healing , so we do not perpetuate our ancestral wounds to the next generation, but allow our own inner child to have a safe space to express what has not been expressed..
.
Just some thoughts this morning as I allowed myself the time to journal, reflect and acknowledge how far I’ve come.
.
Let me know if you relate, and if you feel the need to create a space like that collectively.🙏🏻🌙🌟🌺
