🍽️ 🧽 🫧 Staff writer @alifrancis.me has a theory. There are only two types of cooks in this world: Those who clean as they go and those who let it all pile up for later—and each says a lot about who you are. She dropped her hypothesis in Slack and the BA team went * off * in the comments. It's not just us debating the best way to handle your dishes, either. All over the internet people are taking up the kitchen towel and defending their preferences. Tell us whether you're a chaos machine or meticulous cleaner in the comments below, then head to the link in bio to see what that (probably) says about you. 🎨: @caronewt/Getty Images
