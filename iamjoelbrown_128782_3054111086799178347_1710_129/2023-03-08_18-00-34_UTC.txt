The phrase "it's my truth" has become a common defense mechanism for those who want to justify their beliefs, even if those beliefs are based on little evidence or factual support. 

In reality, truth is exclusive and objective, not subjective or personal. We cannot claim to have our own version of the truth based solely on our feelings or opinions.

It's concerning that in the West, we are starting to prioritize our emotions over facts and critical thinking.

We've become so focused on the idea of individualism and personal experience that we forget the importance of objective truth and critical thinking.

This often leads to a dangerous path where we dismiss factual evidence or reject logical reasoning, all in the name of "our truth" or how we feel about something.

It's time we start to recognize that there is a difference between belief and truth. Beliefs are shaped by our experiences and perceptions, but truth is not.

Truth is based on evidence, facts, and objective reasoning. When we prioritize our feelings over facts, we are doing ourselves and society a disservice.

Let's strive to be more critical and objective in our thinking. Let's search for the facts and evidence before jumping to conclusions.

And let's stop using the phrase "it's my truth" as a defense mechanism for our beliefs. Instead, let's embrace the idea of seeking truth and using critical thinking to make informed decisions.
