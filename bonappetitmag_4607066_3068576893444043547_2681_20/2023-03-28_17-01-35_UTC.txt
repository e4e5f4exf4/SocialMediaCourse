Lettuce remind you that this leafy green is capable of more than just salad duty. Inspired by a classic Chinese cooking technique in which blanched iceberg or romaine ðŸ¥¬ is served with oyster sauce and garlic, @rachelgurjarâ€™s Salty-and-Sour Lettuce gives your leaves a quick blanch to preserve their crunch and color and mild sweetness. Recipe at the link in bio. ðŸ“¸: @rachelgurjar
