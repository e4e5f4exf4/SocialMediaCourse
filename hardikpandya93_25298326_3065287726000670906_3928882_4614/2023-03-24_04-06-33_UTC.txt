From dreaming together to living the dream. Bhai, I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side on this journey called life. We’ve laughed, cried, celebrated, danced and gone through our ups and downs knowing that anything and everything is possible as long as we have each other. Love you bhai and I hope you have the best day and year ahead. I’ll try to be the best HP papa to your son just like you’ve been the best to mine. Happy birthday my love @krunalpandya_official ❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘
