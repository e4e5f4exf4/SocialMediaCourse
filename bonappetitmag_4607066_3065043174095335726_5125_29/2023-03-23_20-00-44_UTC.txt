A celebratory cake if ever there was one, cozy, comforting Appalachian Apple Stack Cake is ubiquitous at weddings and holidays in Virginia. When she makes it for herself, pastry chef @lisamariedonovan stacks the cake 12 layers high. This version—with six layers of spice cake and an orchard’s worth of apple butter—is easier, just as rewarding, and guaranteed to BE the party.
