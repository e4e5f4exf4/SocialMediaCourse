There is a *lot* of food content on TikTok. You can see someone put, say, an entire block of cream cheese (??) into nearly any crock pot recipe. Or watch a food influencer declare whether a restaurant is “mid” or 🔥 “fire.” It’s easy to fall into a rabbit hole 🕳️ of flashy, super fast-paced, sometimes unhinged videos on FoodTok, but is the content actually useful? To answer that question, @samstone000 decided that for an entire week, he’d source as many recipes and restaurant recommendations as possible from TikTok. The results were… well, mixed.
