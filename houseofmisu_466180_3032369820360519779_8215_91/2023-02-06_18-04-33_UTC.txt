Our relationship timeline is pretty straightforward. Girl meets boy . They go on many unforgettable dates , share countless kisses and have several adventures. Boy then asks girl to marry him and she says YES. Some years later they decide to add another little crazy human into their crazy wonderful little world. 
7 years ago today our fate was sealed. Happy anniversary my love and thank you for giving me the greatest gift anyone could hope for - Contentment ❤️
