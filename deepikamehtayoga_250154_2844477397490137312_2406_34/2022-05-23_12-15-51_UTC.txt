Hey guys ,
Im excited to be launching my new online classes on sale from my website.
These are all my foundations of flexibility, core strength and backbending.There is my go-to daily Flexibility sequence that I have been practicing for the last few years, it can be done by yoga practitioners but also anybody looking to maintain there flexibility, despite doing other movement practices.
There is a backbending class which focuses on all the key areas and techniques which in my opinion help to be able to do all levels of Backbends from foundations to advanced.
And there is my fav core strength drills which I did live while shooting the video and trust me had sore abs for the next few days!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
I have also recorded a beautiful restorative Moon menstrual cycle Sequence with a live healing sound bath done by my beautiful friend @komalschronicles.

These are up for sale on My website now. The link is in my bio and stories.
Hope you enjoy this offering of love. ❤️❤️❤️
