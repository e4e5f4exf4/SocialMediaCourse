DOUBLE TAP ❤️ to affirm this!⁠
⁠
Forget about your limitations.⁠
⁠
These are the preconceived notions you believe about yourself, such as that your memory isn’t good or that you’re a slow learner.⁠
⁠
We’re not born with pre-installed mindsets about what we’re capable of achieving—we learn these fixed and limited ways of thinking from the people in our lives and the culture we experience growing up. 💔⁠
⁠
Think of a young elephant tied to a stake in the ground. 🐘⁠
⁠
When it’s a baby, the elephant isn’t strong enough to pull the stake up, so it eventually stops trying because it learns the effort is futile.⁠
⁠
As the elephant grows, it gains more than enough power and strength to pull out the stake, but it remains tied up by something as inconsequential as a rope and a flimsy piece of metal because of what it learned as a baby.⁠
⁠
In Psychology, it’s called learned helplessness. 🧠⁠
⁠
Most of us behave like that elephant.⁠
⁠
At some point, we had an experience that gave us an impression of what we’re capable of, and our belief about our potential has been set ever since. 😞⁠
⁠
But just as helplessness is learned, it’s just as possible to learn to be limitless. ⚡️⁠
