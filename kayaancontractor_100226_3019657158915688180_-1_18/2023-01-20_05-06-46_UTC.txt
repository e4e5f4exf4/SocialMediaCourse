Jackie and Me; a timeless love.
.
Timeless and versatile, the Jackie continues to elevate looks era after era with such elegance. A key design of the House for many decades, the Jackie has been reimagined several times over the years. Its newest incarnation, the Jackie 1961, emerges to transcend traditional accessories classifications with its pared-down silhouette, piston hardware, and non-binary attitude.
A longstanding signature within the House’s collection, the Jackie is perfect for every occasion, no matter the hour, no matter the destination.
