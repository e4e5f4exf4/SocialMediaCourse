Mahagatha (100 tales from the Puranas) penned by @satyarthnayak published by @harpercollinsin 

Mythological genre is one of my favourites and so is this book. Mahagatha - 100 tales from the puranas. I was smitten write from the time I laid my eyes on the cover. The best part of the tales if that itâ€™s in a chronological order and you cannot start randomly from any chapter. I had set a ritual of either reading a couple of tales in the morning or at night before going to bed. The stories are complimented with a few illustrations throughout the book which I am going to colour soon and still be connected to the book. The author has narrated the Mahagatha in such a simple and entertaining way that you get glued and can visualise the entire yugas. With his words he transports you to the 250 CE to 1500 CE. #i highly recommend this one if you want to enlighten yourselves with Hindu mythology in an entertaining way.
