I strive to make healthy choices every day, and one such choice is to include @californiawalnutsindia in my daily diet regime. They are so easy to grab and go and integrate into my wellness routine. I love them whole as a healthy snack, in my salads, as part of my mains to boost the nutritional value, and in my desserts. Eating just a handful of California walnuts, which are packed with 2.5g plant-based omega-3 ALA, 4g protein, and 2g fiber, keeps me fueled and focused throughout the day.  

California walnuts are a smart choice. The ideal climate, fertile soils, and the farmers dedication to providing high quality make them one of the best options available in the market. They combine nutrition, versatility, high quality, exceptional flavour and so much more. That’s why I say #ThinkWalnutsThinkCalifornia

California walnuts are available at all grocery stores and e-commerce sites. Make sure to look for the California Walnuts logo mark, “California” or “Californian” on the package or produce of the USA to ensure that you are buying genuine, high-quality California walnuts.
