And the Year Begins so does our time to set new goals and intentions ðŸ¥³ as a reader I have always set challenges for myself which motivates me to read more as I have to achieve my target before the year ends. I suggest you do so it will help you being disciplined, wonâ€™t let you go into a reading slump and itâ€™s fun too to set a target and achieve it. Last year I I read 114 (one hundred and fourteen) books time to set a new target and challenge in 2023. Letâ€™s see what this year holds. I use Goodreads to set my reading challenge ðŸ“š
Happy Reading to all #bookstagrammer
