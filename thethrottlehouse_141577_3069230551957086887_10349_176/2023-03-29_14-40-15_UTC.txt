Its here, the new Aventador replacement. The REVUELTO, which means scrambled but also represents a rowdy fighting bull.

Highlights:

6.5L Naturally Aspirated V12 paired with three electric motors (2 front, 1 rear) that altogether make 1,001 Horsepower.

Redline is 9,500 RPM.

AWD.

New in-house developed transverse 8-speed dual clutch.

2.5 seconds to 60. 217 mph top speed.

Battery can recharge fully in 6 minutes from driving (regenerative braking and the V12)

New Citta (City) mode, which is EV only and has 6 miles of range.

Lighter and stiffer frame than the aventador but dry weight is still about 500 lbs more despite a carbon monocoque.

At first glance, it looks like they’ve thrown everything at this. And the plugin stuff would scare us if it didn’t work so extraordinarily well in the 296 Ferrari we just tested. Pluck my butt hair and call me Sally because we’re ready for this new almost 4,000 lbs Italian monster, are you?
