We've all had that moment of paralysing fear before speaking in public, giving a presentation, or even just starting a casual conversation with a new person.

It can be hard to deal with the fear of being embarrassed, judged, or seen as less than. It's easy to get stuck in a cycle of our own doubts and fears.

But I've learned from my own experience that most people are so caught up in their own thoughts and worries that they're not even listening to yours.

The truth is that we all feel insecure sometimes, and that's okay. But if we let them run our lives, they can stop us from living the way we want.

Let's not let the fear of being embarrassed control what we do. Instead, let's embrace the power of self-acceptance. Let's give ourselves permission to be vulnerable and take risks, even if it means we might get embarrassed.

Because in the end, knowing we are already loved by God and that our own thoughts are the only ones that really matter is so powerful to know. And when we can accept ourselves, flaws and all and give the rest to God, we open ourselves up to a whole world of possibilities.

So, the next time you let your fear of being embarrassed keep you locked up, remember that you are not alone.

We all have fears, but it's up to us to get over them and live the life we want.

Share this message with your friends and family, let's start a conversation and break the cycle of self-doubt together.
