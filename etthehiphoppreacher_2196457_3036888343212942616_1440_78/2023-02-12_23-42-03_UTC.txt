Repost  @s2spodcast I know this doesn‚Äôt need to be said but I‚Äôll say it anyways‚Ä¶ E is the absolute üêê. People always ask about our relationship and why I‚Äôve been his 2 man for so long and why I still remain so‚Ä¶ I always tell them it has NOTHING to do with the fact that he‚Äôs the best speaker in the world (which he is). It has EVERYTHING to do with the man he is. This dude took 40 kids from the inner city to the SuperBowl! This is on the heels of sending 10 kids to Dubai. No extra cameras, no sponsors, no help from the NFL, just one man on a mission to change the world. Love you and got your back till we outta here!!!! @etthehiphoppreacher ~CJ
