"I finished the book this morning and have dozens of folded pages. I've followed Michael since shortly after he launched his blog and this is hands down, the most impactful book/material I've read. This partnership between Meghan Hyatt Miller and Michael Hyatt will likely be something I return to twice a year as a cornerstone to center my mindset, particularly as I consider my goals and commitments. The beauty of this book, however, is the transformation it can have daily in course-correcting as the Narrator's voice tells me unhelpful stories. Thank you for making the time and doing the research to create such a quality book." ⁠
