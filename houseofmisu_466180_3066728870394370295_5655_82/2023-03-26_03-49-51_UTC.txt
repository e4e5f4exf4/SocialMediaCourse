Because without su there ain’t no mi. 
Happy birthday to the best friend a girl could ever ask for. The wind beneath my wings , the noodles in my ramen , the oat milk in my tea … the family I found when I wasn’t even looking. Thank you for being there for me during the good times and the bad. Thank you for telling me what I needed to hear and not what I wanted to hear. Thank you for this lifetime of friendship  And a lifetime more. I love you old gal. #misufam #bff #misuforlife
