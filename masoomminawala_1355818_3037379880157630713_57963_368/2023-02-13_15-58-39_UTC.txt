And just like that… Back on the runway ❤️ 

I know I look different. And frankly, I don’t mind it.

This body, full of stretch marks and curves is a testament to the power of women.

And if my job gives me the priceless opportunity to share it with 5000 people as I walk down a ramp wearing India’s most celebrated designers, I’m going to do it. And I’m going to do it proudly. 

And so I did.
