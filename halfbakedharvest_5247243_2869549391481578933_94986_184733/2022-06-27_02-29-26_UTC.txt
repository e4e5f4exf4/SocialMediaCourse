GIVEAWAY 🦋 I said this was coming (: the support you all show me is INSANE. 12 weeks and counting on the NYT best sellers list, 5 ⭐️ amazon reviews for all 3 cookbooks, and endless amounts of love + excitement. We have the kindest, most supportive community. It’s crazy and I love y’all like family. So per everyone’s many request, we’re gifting 5 winners each a KitchenAid stand mixer + signed copies of all 3 cookbooks. Tag a friend (or friends!) in the comments. Giveaway has ended. I messaged all 5 winners. Thank you for entertaining everyone!
