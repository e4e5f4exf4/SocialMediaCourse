Every interaction, every connection, and every encounter in life is not simply a coincidence, but rather a result of a greater force at play.

When you ask God to draw people near to you that are meant to be in your life you will start to witness incredible experiences unfold.

These moments are not just random occurrences, but instead, they hold a special meaning and purpose.

When we open ourselves up to the possibilities of what these connections can bring, we allow for a deeper understanding of our own lives and the world around us. 

Embrace the power of purposeful encounters, and see how they can shape, inspire, and uplift you.

Life is full of opportunities to connect and grow, and it's up to us to seize them with open arms and an open heart.
