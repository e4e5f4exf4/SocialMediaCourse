There was a time I was terrified of push ups.. I was terrible at it!! I worked on it and got better and then had an accident, broke the rib and tore some muscles and had to start the push up journey all over again! I got better again.. and the other day dad @samir.purohit said, “come, let’s push up and take a leg off!”.. I thought no way I’ll manage, but gave it a shot anyway! And here we are doing a push up and even holding it for a picture! Thanks for pushing me dad ⭐️🙏🏻 I would not have tried it without your encouragement.. and I’m also so proud of me ⭐️ giving myself a little pat on the back for coming a long long way 🔥❤️ guess it’s true.. WHEN THERE’S A WILL THERE’S A WAY!
