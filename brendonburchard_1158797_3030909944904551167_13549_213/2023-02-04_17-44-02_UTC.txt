Teaching time. Let me tell you about IOA, which is “immediate opposite action.”

You feel tired and terrrible, so you take an immediate opposite action to the feeling: you do something that will build up energy. 

You do *not* double down on the behavior making you feel like trash. 

That’s IOA.

Another example:

You *feel* mad at, and distant from, your spouse. 

What do you do?

You can:

A. Double down on that feeling and distance yourself, shut down, get more mad, stew on negative feelings, get in fights. ie cause more of the *same*

Or 

B. IOA: immediate opposite action: flip the madness and challenge yourself to increase closeness, get present and kind. Ask questions. Hold space. Open up. Work through to a higher level. Generate what you really want: LOVE.

Funny how so many of life’s great improvements come from sensing negative feelings and then doing something to bring good things in versus double down on the pain. 

You can feel the feeling, acknowledge and understand it, but not be controlled by it and make a BETTER CHOICE. 

That’s free will and conscious behavior that changes your life. 

Share with someone today. Every day is a great day to learn and grow. 

Cheering you on today. 
Your coach,
