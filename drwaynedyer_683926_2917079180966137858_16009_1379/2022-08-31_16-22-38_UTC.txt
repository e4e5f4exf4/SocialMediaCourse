7 years ago yesterday, our loving Dad passed away. We wanted to say thank you for keeping his memory and spirit alive. We read every message and appreciate all of your kind words more than you will ever know. 
Every time someone shares a story of how our dad’s work touched or impacted their lives we are all deeply touched at how much he not only reached so many people with his powerful voice and words, but how he is still doing that, only now from the other side. We celebrate him by continuing to practice random acts of kindness, just as he always enjoyed doing. ❤️❤️❤️
