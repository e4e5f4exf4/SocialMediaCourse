Love is a beautiful thing, but not when it comes at the cost of your mental health and happiness. 

Toxic relationship patterns can be hard to spot, but recognizing the red flags early on can save you from years of pain and suffering.

Remember, you deserve a relationship built on trust, respect, and mutual love. Don't settle for anything less.
