Baked Crunchy Hot Honey Chicken. Everyone’s favorite Sunday/Monday night dinner. And hands down the current most popular recipe I’ve shared all year long. This is GOOD - baked until extra crips, then covered in my hot honey sauce. It’s all about the sauce, I always say to double it (: Ranch on the side with baked French fries. Perfect dinner.
