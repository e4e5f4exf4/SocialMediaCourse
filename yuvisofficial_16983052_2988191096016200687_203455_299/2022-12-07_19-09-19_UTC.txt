Humbled to be recognised as the Youth Icon of the Year by @leadersoftomorrowetnow. 

It's an honour and a responsibility to be in a position where I can influence youth in the right way. 

Looking forward to keeping the head held high as we travel down this road of promising opportunities. 

Miles to go before I sleep, miles to go before I sleep..
