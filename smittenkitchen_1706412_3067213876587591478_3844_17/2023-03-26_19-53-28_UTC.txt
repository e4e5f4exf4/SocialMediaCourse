Don't be intimidated by the ingredient list length -- this vegetarian, vegetable-full, complexly flavored stew comes together quickly and is fantastic over couscous, with or without a dollop of yogurt to finish it. Leftovers reheat well, so it's a meal prep dream too. // Squash and Chickpea Moroccan Stew on smittenkitchen.com or linked in profile. In more detail: Go to my profile.
