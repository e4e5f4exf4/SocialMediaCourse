Here are three tactics you can use to arrive at your desired destination, no matter how long it takes.⁠
⁠
1️⃣ Keep your goals visible. The first page of the Full Focus Planner is designed to facilitate daily goal review. Just scanning your list on a regular basis will help you make progress; you’ll be more attuned to next steps—the small but meaningful actions that get you one step closer to achieving your goal.⁠
⁠
2️⃣ Connect to your why. To amplify that effect, review your goal motivations on a weekly basis in your Weekly Preview. Stay connected to whatever compelled you to pursue the goal in the first place. The more you can find deeply personal motivation for achievement the better.⁠
⁠
3️⃣ Pivot as necessary. What matters is the destination, not how you get there. As our CEO Megan Hyatt Miller often says, “The goal is sacred, but not the strategy.” That’s why she and our founder, Michael Hyatt, wrote their new book Mind Your Mindset. It’s practically a manual on how to pivot when you need.⁠
⁠
Your goals matter. That’s why you set them in the first place. Don’t let them die like a plant you forgot to water. Keep them visible, stay connected to your why, and change your approach until you reach your destination.⁠
