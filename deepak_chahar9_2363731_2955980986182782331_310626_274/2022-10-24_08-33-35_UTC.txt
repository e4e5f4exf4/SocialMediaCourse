Namaste!
As Indians, we all have a set of traditions that are passed on through generations and some we create ourselves. We have ours too and thoroughly enjoying creating new ones with our family this Diwali. 
Traditions make you feel stronger  together. 
We are loving our family time and here's wishing you the same.

 A very Happy & Safe Diwali from our family to yours!
