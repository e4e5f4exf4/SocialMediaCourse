Just like gardens, relationships require consistent care and attention to flourish.

If you neglect them, the weeds of misunderstandings, miscommunications, and mistrust can quickly take hold, and before you know it, the beautiful relationship you once had can become overrun with negativity.

But just as a garden can be restored to its former glory with a little bit of TLC, relationships can be salvaged as well. The key is to recognize the warning signs of neglect and address them before they have a chance to grow.

Nurturing a relationship means actively showing your appreciation and affection for the other person.

And finally, attention is crucial for any relationship to thrive. This means being present in the moment and actively listening when the other person speaks. It means putting aside distractions like phones or work, and really focusing on the person in front of you.

Giving your full attention to your loved ones lets them know that they are valued and respected, and that their thoughts and feelings are important to you.
