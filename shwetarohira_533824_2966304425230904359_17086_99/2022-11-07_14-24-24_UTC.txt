Father of the Bride - To - Be by Jeet Gian @jeet_gian 

Let’s start cover to cover. Right from the the cover I knew it’s going to be a fun read and the book kept up to my expectations. This is one of those books that makes you smile and laugh along your busy schedule. The book is narrated in a chatty and a sectoral style which makes the read interesting and you sublimely are an integral part of the story. As the title suggest the book is about Shakuntala Bassi the bride to be and her father Ramswarup Bassi. Well Shakuntala has rejected thousand of boys but now she is rejected by Jacky Zinta by her dream man for a bizarre reason and we all know how difficult it is to take rejection. So anyways this father- daughter due team up to make Jacky agree to marriage. Also I guess all father and daughters will relate to it either the situations or the bond that Shakuntala and Ramswarup share. The question that lies here and the stories begins will they succeed? It’s a book I would recommend to read as it’s fast paced and entertaining. I throughly enjoyed it.
