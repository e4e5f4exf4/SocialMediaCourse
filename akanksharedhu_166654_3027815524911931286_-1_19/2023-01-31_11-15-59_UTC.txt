a T H O U S A N D yesses to this Burrata salad that was inhaled today at @tbsp.tablespoon 
Loved the food, loved the cute interiors that make me feel as if I'm lunching in my own kitchen and puts me more at ease while eating (not that I need to feel more at ease while eating iykwim)
We LOVED having these:
~ Burrata salad
~ Minestrone soup (not pictured but YUM)
~ The salmon large plate (SO good)
~ Mushroom gnocchi
~ Chocolate Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e 
The real dessert is ofcourse in the last slide üêí
