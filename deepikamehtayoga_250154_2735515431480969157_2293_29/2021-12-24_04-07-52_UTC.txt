Working on finding my balance.🌟
The last few days we took off for a little holiday , and just being very deeply immersed in nature and simplicity , made me reconnect to my essence, i had the realisation that I may never be the old Deepika again that I was before my little babygirl came along, as a dear friend and pro mom reminded me , but I want to find the balance between this new person, yet staying connected to my spirit.

Change is sometimes challenging but it’s always the biggest teacher.💜🦋🙏🏻
