Is there a goal in your life you’ve been working toward that you just can’t seem to accomplish?⁠
⁠
These seemingly “unachievable goals” are the reason Megan Hyatt Miller and I wrote Mind Your Mindset, which is why I’m moved when I read reviews like Cari’s.⁠
⁠
Here’s the story she shared with us after reading the book.⁠
⁠
“I’ve always wanted to lose weight. I’ve tried the Keto Diet, Paleo Diet, SlimFast (back in the day), and hiring a personal trainer. But something always seems to get in my way. I never seem to be able to keep it up. I get inspired at first, but somewhere along the way things get uncomfortable, I get tired or bored, and I give up. The “narrator” starts up and derails my progress.⁠
Mind Your Mindset helped me see the real problem is my beliefs about myself. The lie I’ve believed is a story that says, “I can’t do it.” Or “This is too hard.” Or “These other people’s issues are more important right now (kids, husband, employer).” Or “I don’t deserve to be thin.” The book showed me how to identify the false stories I believe, expose them for what they are, and write a new narrative that serves me better.⁠
⁠
Mind Your Mindset is about identifying your “narrator” (your mindset) and changing the narrative you are being told by your own mind and experiences. It helped me realize why I am not reaching my goals; that my narrator has been telling me a story that blocks my path to success.⁠
⁠
I would recommend it to anyone struggling with imposter syndrome, inability to accomplish a goal, or negative reactions to situations such as public speaking or dealing with conflict.”⁠
⁠
Like Cari, you can identify the lies that hold you back from your goals, and you can rewrite them to live a better, truer story. We show you how in Mind Your Mindset. ⁠
