#ZeeZestDigitalCoverStar 

On International Women’s Day 2023, introducing our Digital Cover Star Tahira Kashyap Khurrana! 
 
@tahirakashyap is a force to reckon with. She's bold, unfiltered, unapologetic and has created an identity of her own. Her nuanced writing and empowering women-centric stories make her the perfect fit for our Women’s Day special digital cover.
 
The filmmaker confesses how she didn’t indulge in self-love for the longest time and used to look down upon herself, “For me that was being narcissist, but there’s a huge difference between self-love and narcissism. Self-love is truly constructive, while narcissism is very destructive.”
