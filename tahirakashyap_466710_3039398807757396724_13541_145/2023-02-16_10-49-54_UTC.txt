#ishowedup and it’s taken a year, still in process… what’s the target? Just better than yesterday if you ask me. Why post it? Need validation? Maybe because I worked my a** off, so yea when anyone appreciates it’s motivating. There’s nothing wrong with that, atleast for me. 
This too is an authentic version of myself and I like it. 
My learning from my 20’s ( ever heard of it’s wiser to learn from others experiences, pls do 🙏) -
I still don’t need to fit into a certain size . 
I don’t need to give up on carbs. 
My life is beyond sweating out in the gym. Food gives me happiness, no point giving it up. 
And so consistency is the only key❤️
.
This post is also to share with you that if I ever go off track ( which I am sure I will) तो मुह पे मारना मेरे यही post 😄❤️ #healthylifestyle #workout 

P.s- thought a few times before posting this stabbing my own belief. A fleeting thought came that maybe I should become more fit , thinner on the waist…but no I am so happy I took the courage to dump this stereotypical thought into the bin and I am cherishing what I have today!
