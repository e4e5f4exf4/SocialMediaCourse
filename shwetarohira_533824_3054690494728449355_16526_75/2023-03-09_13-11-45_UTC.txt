Where Love was Sinful - Chirasree Bose @chirasreebose_ 

Right from the title the book has me it’s like a spider web that entangled me and every page unravels a layer that surprised me or rather I would say shocked me. Kudos to the author who so well has crafted a story with so many characters and each one of them with different layers and back stories. It’s a book that has every ingredient required for a perfect drama thriller. It has love, friendships, relationships, politics, greed, jealousy, adulatory, lust and more. It took me a couple of sitting to read the book as after few chapters I felt like analysing the characters and their stories as to their reasoning for their particular sin. It’s a story about umpteenth sins but all for one reason love. But the catch here is love for different emotions. Deep right!!! Hence I would says it’s a story with a lot of depth. To give you a little snippet it’s a story of three main characters Shaaman, Maya and Aahil. As maya arrives in Delhi to meet her husband Shaaman family and for a celebration, mysterious deaths start taking place in the house and what should have been a celebration turns catastrophic. There is a story between maya and aahil too which is sinful. Now you may wonder who is Aahil but if I tell you anything more it would be a spoiler. I would recommend you to read and unravel the mystery yourself. I also have to when I read the last book penned by the author I was amazed at the nail biting suspense thriller as I couldn’t till the end guess what was in store for me but here again she has amazed me and broken her own record with another suspense thriller. It’s a book I would recommend all mystery lovers who would like to have an amazing thrilling time.
