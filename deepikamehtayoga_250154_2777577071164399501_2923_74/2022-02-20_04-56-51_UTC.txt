Project strength for jump back, jump throughs for the Ashtanga practice continues.🔥💪🏽
Core +bent and straight arm strength of shoulders +legs all adds up to better efficiency of movement, the stronger your muscles (not necessarily bigger muscles though!) the lighter your movements.💪🏽🤸🏽‍♀️🤸🏽‍♀️🔥
.
These drills done 2 times a week alongside your practice can really help big time .
Do them for a month or 2 at least consistently to see any results.
Remember consistency is the name of the game , not jumping into every new program/ coach/ training/ trainer/ yoga teacher every few days.( the same with diets!!!!!🤪) 

NOBODY can give you the magic pill , the teacher/ coach can show you to the best of their ability , finally you HAVE to do the work.
It took me years of training any new movement/ asana/ handstand to be able to do it finally.
.
So here are the drills.
.
1️⃣Bent arm Lolasana Push/ ups : 5 reps* 3 sets (1 min rest between sets )
.
2️⃣Lolasana Lift-ups : 5 reps *3 sets (1 min rest between sets )
.
3️⃣Push ups (if you are advanced do them with straight legs ): 10 reps * 3 sets 
.
4️⃣L- Sits : 10 reps * 3 sets 
.
5️⃣Tolasana : 5 reps * 3 sets 
.
