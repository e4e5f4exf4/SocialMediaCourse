Compare yourself not to others, but only to the vision you hold within your heart. Dedicate your life to a cause greater than yourself and watch you get beyond yourself. The very thing that someone told you that you would never be able to do may just be the very thing you are destined to do.ðŸ’œ

-John Fredrick Demartini
