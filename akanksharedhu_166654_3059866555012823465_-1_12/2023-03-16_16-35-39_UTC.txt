What the beginning of summer has been about - mostly me, but also a few other things of love.
~ #MeInMirrors 
~ The Petrea Volubilis Saga IYKYK
~ Linens are out ðŸ¤Œ
~ Some of my faves: books, @deepikaguleria, coffee (not in frame) & a coffee+bookshop
~ Over-sized white shirts in all different styles are welcome
~ Sometimes broken things make the whole picture more interesting
~ My right arm taking that rare break
~ I was either preparing myself mentally for the day ahead or was completely done with it already. You can't tell which, by my expression.
How is your summer going?
