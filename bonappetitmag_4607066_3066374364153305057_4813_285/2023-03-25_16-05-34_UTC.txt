We’re back with another Receipt 🧾. We’re sharing how a 36-year-old marketing manager eats in San Francisco, California. She makes $225K including base, bonuses, and stock, and she lives in a dual-income household totaling about $500K-$600K. She cooks dal, barbacoa, and chicken curry for her husband and two children; her family's grocery staples include Goldfish crackers, eggs, cheese, fruit snacks, and fish. Her three year old loves caviar... yes, caviar. "My mom used to work 12-hour shifts in a factory, come home, and make bhaji, chapati, rice 🍚, and dal every day for us," she writes. Her family immigrated from India to the US when she was eight. "I occasionally spend more 💲 on one meal than [my parents] probably made in a month. I’m embarrassed by this sometimes, but this is why they uprooted their lives and brought us here, right? So their daughter could have very unhealthy food/spending habits?" Her most expensive purchase was a dinner at @yakitorikokko, and her least expensive purchase was a lemon from Whole Foods. Read more at the link in bio. 🎨 Art: @maggiemargaret_cowles
