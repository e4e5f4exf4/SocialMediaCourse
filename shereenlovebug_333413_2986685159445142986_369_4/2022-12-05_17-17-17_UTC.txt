Dearest Shereen @shereenlovebug 
From a thought exchanged over a DM  on Aug 27th to “Its a film wrap”on Dec 3rd 2:20 am - What a journey. Your dedication and hard-work are awe inspiring. 
We are amazed at your staunch commitment to what we three chose to undertake! As an artist you have come a long way and we are proud of the journey you have charted in these last months, with sincerity and graceful nervousness. It has been a pleasure to have directed you and watched you own those frames. You were present at all times. 
Together, We cannot  wait to complete this creation. We love you for just who you are. ✨

Don’t Worry Be Happy
