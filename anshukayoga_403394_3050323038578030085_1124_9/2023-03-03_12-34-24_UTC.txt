Dear Mamas 🤰🤰🤰
Re-connect with your body through your Yoga practice🧘🏻‍♀️ 💖

Thank you @punetimesonline, for highlighting the delicate and crucial postnatal journey of new mothers and how Yoga can be incorporated in their life to re-connect with themselves.

Breathwork, pranayama, inversions and certain asanas are what will help you to deal with pre and postpartum symptoms and bounce back to your old self.

Give this a read, we surely need more awareness when it comes to the post-natal journey of new mothers.
