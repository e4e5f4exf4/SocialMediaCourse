For @zaynab_issa, three types of Sehri come to mind: The one she wakes up for on weekdays before work, the one where she eats at 2 or 3 a.m. after a long night at the mosque, and the one where she’s hosting. No matter the type of Sehri you’re having, these recipes will carry you through Ramadan. From peanut butter and jelly oatmeal to tandoori buffalo wings, find all the recipes at the link in bio. 📷 Photo: @isa.zapata 🍴 Food Styling: @tanekamorris 🥣 Prop Styling: @williager7
