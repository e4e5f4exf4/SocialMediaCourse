I had a beautiful Balinese Chakra Healing mediation with this incredible woman, Komang Sukerni , she scanned my chakras and chanted beautifully, we both share a beautiful connection to our roots of Hinduism, hers through Balinese Hinduism and mine through Indian Hinduism, our way of chanting might be different but the connection to the Universal Energy and Source is the same.Also i truely believe now that Mantras are Universal affirmations and when chanted with a sincere intention (not ego) they can help manifest are deepest spiritual desires.🔯
.
I felt like sharing here our simple chanting together,
The first chant is Gayatri Mantra to the Divine Source , We meditate on that most adored Supreme Lord, the creator, whose divine light illumines all realms (physical, mental and spiritual). 
.
The second mantra we chanted  was Triyambakam or Mahamrityunjaya Mantra to Lord Shiva for health, longevity and healing.
.
The last mantra we chanted  together was Lokah Samasthah Sukhino Bhavantu for peace and harmony for every being on this planet.🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
.
Felt so special to share this special connection. 🙏🏻☮️🔯
