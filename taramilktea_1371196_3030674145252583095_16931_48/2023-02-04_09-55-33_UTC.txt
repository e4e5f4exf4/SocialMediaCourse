Grateful for my third year attending the Australian Open with @kiaaustralia! There’s nothing quite like live tennis. The energy is unbeatable & last Sunday night’s match was no different. I even got a cheeky selfie with the champion! 🎾 🏆 Thank you @kiaaustralia for such an epic evening.
P.S. Cant wait to share more from our Drive Day experiencing the brand new #EV6GT! #ad
