So grateful for the magical beings showing up in my life, to support my Journey, to staying connected to my purpose yet to showing up completely as a mom…(although I do believe part of my purpose and relearning is from being a mom )..
..this  journey that is always unexpected and like a whirlwind of chaos ..everyday !!!!!!🌊🌊🙈
This mama needs to have her feet (..or her hands !!!) firmly  grounded so she can show up in this uncertainty and chaos with her heart open.🤍
Grateful that the Universe shows up in such magical ways ..it truely does.❤️
And so I feel like sharing this from my heart today especially to all you beautiful souls out there who like me are used to always showing up with perfection, structure and control .., don’t be afraid to open up to your vulnerability and chaos no matter how raw and out of control it makes you feel, no matter how strong ,together and incredible you are used to being ..
As Rumi says ..”When you let go of who you are , you become who you might be “ ..and “Only from the Heart, can you touch the sky ..”❤️
