Culinarily speaking, @kendrakendrakendra thinks this is the most perplexing time of the year. With the changing of the seasons comes the arrival of spring produce, but in the northeast, it still feels like winter. Enter this Potato and Pea Chowder, one of many recipes Kendra developed for Winter Part II. Heavy cream and potatoes add richness to this one-pot dinner while the addition of peas remind you that True Spring is just around the corner. 📷 Photo: @isa.zapata, 🍴 Food Styling: @thubuser, 🥣 Prop Styling: @bethpakradooni
