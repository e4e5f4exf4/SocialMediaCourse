A little dump of our successful and inspirational Team Retreat at @oleanderfarms âœ¨ 
So proud of everything we have achieved and even more excited about whatâ€™s to come!!

Thank you @oleanderfarms for welcoming us so warmly in Karjat and hosting us for the whole week. Couldnâ€™t have thought of a more beautiful property for us to stay ðŸ¤Ž Karjat is actually only 2 hours away from Mumbai and Oleander Farms has not only space for overnight stays, but also different eateries and lots of entertainment for Kids & Adults ðŸ˜‰ From trekking to wine tasting, everything one can wish for ðŸ¥°
And a big thank you to @doitup.today who beautifully decorated the Lakeside for our last evening ðŸ¥°
