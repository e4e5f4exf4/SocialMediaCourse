Unhealed childhood trauma can sometimes turn a person into a narcissist, but refusing to heal only perpetuates their toxic behavior, leaving a trail of broken relationships in their wake.

While we can't control someone else's healing journey, we can choose who we allow into our lives and take responsibility for our own heartbreak.

And of course, labeling every heartbreak as a narcissist's doing is easy, but it doesn't always tell the whole story.

I’m noticing that people are becoming more selfish lately because of social media and all the selfie culture in this significance driven culture (which is what Jesus warned us would happen in these times 2,000 years ago).

“But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: For men and women will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.” - Jesus (2 Timothy 3-5)

It’s important to not be pulled into the selfish survival techniques that so many use in society today.

I also see that sometimes people are wrongly accused of being a narcissist too because the one who is accusing is quick to throw the label out there and can’t see the part they played in the relationship breakdown.

Ultimately, taking ownership of our own choices in relationships means acknowledging our role in attracting and keeping certain people in our lives.

Only then can we break the cycle of toxic patterns and create healthier, more fulfilling connections.

Do you agree?
