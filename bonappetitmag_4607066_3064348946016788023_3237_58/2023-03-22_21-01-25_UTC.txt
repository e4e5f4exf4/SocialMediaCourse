Author Mike Scalise (@scalisetagram), a born-and-raised Yinzer (a.k.a. proud Pittsburgher), built a road trip itinerary sharing the best ways to get to know the Appalachian roots of this city. Packed with pepperoni rolls, Taiwanese sausage fried rice, dirty grits and loaded fries, Scaliseâ€™s itinerary is as vibrant tour of Appalachiaâ€™s largest city.
