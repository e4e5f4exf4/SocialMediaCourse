The capacity to imagine a wide range of stories largely set the bounds of our experience. Why? Because the stories at our disposal drive the strategies, we use to pursue our goals. The ability to imagine a better state of affairs is what drives human progress, achievement, and flourishing. And the ability to reimagine our stories when we’re stuck or stalled is what enables us to improve our lives, become more productive at work, take control of our health, become better spouses, friends, parents, and more.⁠

This imagination is the product of the stories our Narrator is weaving with the neurons in our brains. And it’s the difference between climbing mountains and lowering our expectations.⁠
