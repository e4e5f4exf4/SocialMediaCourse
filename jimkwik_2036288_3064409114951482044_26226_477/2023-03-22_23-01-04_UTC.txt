Leave a “YES” below if you agree 👇⁠
⁠
A reminder that when you only do what’s easy (put things off, procrastinate, the least effort, etc), life is hard. ⁠
⁠
Do what’s hard (and even a little scary), and life becomes easier. 💪⁠
⁠
Because like building any muscle - growth and strength is developed outside our comfort zone.⁠
⁠
Ask yourself, will the rewards outweigh the effort?⁠
⁠
If yes, quiet the noise and get to work, because intelligent consistent action (especially when you are scared or don’t feel like it) cures most everything, including the fear itself. ✨⁠
⁠
If that doesn’t motivate you, then at least use fear wisely and to your advantage.⁠
⁠
Instead of being scared of doing the thing you know you should do, be more scared of what you will lose by not doing it. ⁠
