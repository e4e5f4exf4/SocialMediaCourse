We did it! 💍 🎉 

Don't give up on Love!

I know firsthand how painful it can be to have your heart broken and to carry the wounds of childhood into adulthood.

But I also know that healing is possible and that setting high standards for love is worth it.

Remember, the love you seek is seeking you too.

Have faith that your soul mate is out there, willing to build a family and a life with you.

My wife @sariniabryant showed me that soulmates do exist, and I believe that God brought us together.

You are deserving of a love that is healthy, real, and fulfilling too but it must be negotiated through your actions not just because you hope it will happen.

And when the time comes, the love that is revealed in you and your complimentary other will be worth the wait.

Keep your eyes open, your heart full and your head held high.

When you set the standard for how you want to be treated, you'll attract someone who's on the same page and ready to give and receive love in a powerful way.

I am forever grateful for the gift of my wife, and for the love that we share.

Together, we are a force to be reckoned with, and I know that with God on our side, there is nothing that we cannot overcome.

In Genesis 2:18 The Lord God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.”

This verse emphasizes the importance of companionship and partnership between man and woman, and highlights the idea that humans are created for relationship with one another.

It is in our Original Human Design to Love and be Loved 🧬❤️

So, if you’re reading this and you have felt doubt about your relationship journey along the way - Keep moving forward with growth and trust that when the time is right, you'll attract the soulmate you've been praying for 🙏🏼

Sarinia and I believe in the power of Real Love for you too ❤️
