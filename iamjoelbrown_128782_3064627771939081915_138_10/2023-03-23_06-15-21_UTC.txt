Success is often just a few failures away. Are you ready to embrace failure in pursuit of your dreams? 🚀

Throughout my 29-year entrepreneurial journey, I've launched 9 businesses, only 4 of which have become sustainable successes.

I started at the age of 7, and every step of the way, I've learned that failure is an essential part of growth.🌱

The path to mastery can be messy, but it's the journey that truly shapes us – not the accolades we collect along the way. 🏆

That's why I'm thrilled to introduce my INFLUENTIAL COACH certification program! 

This 4-month online program distills my 14 years of coaching expertise, empowering you to become a transformative coach and build a thriving 6-7+ figure career. 🌟

If you're ready to start a coaching business from scratch or elevate your coaching practice then send me a DM with the word 'COACH,' and I'll share the application details. 

If you make it to the second round, we'll have a personal call to ensure we're the perfect fit. But act fast – we're already 55% full! ⏳
