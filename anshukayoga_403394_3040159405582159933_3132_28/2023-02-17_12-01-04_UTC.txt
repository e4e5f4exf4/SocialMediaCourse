Blissful days and therapeutic experiences 💚🧘🏻‍♀️ 

Nourishing my soul with 🍃

Yoga Nidra- a calming and soothing session, surrounded by nature and the melodious sounds of the flute.

Trataka Meditation 🕯️(candle gazing), which helps improve focus, mental health and spiritual awareness.

Compression Therapy that helps increase blood circulation, revive muscles and reduce inflammation.

Ayurveda Apothecary, where I learned to make my my own concoctions.

These therapies have helped me feel lighter and more connected to myself 🤍
