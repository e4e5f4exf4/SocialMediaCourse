ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ @wall_street_trapper  Understand That We are Programmed To be consumers of Stuff, things that take away from our wealth.

Things that depreciate out purchasing power & suffocate us financially.

Itâ€™s the common thread not just through the hoods, but through the lower class.

We increase our value not by looking for the system to give us direction, but by educating ourselves son how wealth is built.

Letâ€™s make 2023 the year where we insert wealth principles & values into our family.

AND INTRODUCE OUR FAMILY TO WEALTH

Do you agree? #youoweyou
