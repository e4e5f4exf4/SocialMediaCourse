I've had a loving and fine seasoned relationship with @kharakapas and their clothing. Meaning 'pure cotton' this is a slow brand with thoughtful pieces that i always find myself lusting after, season after season. Like this 'a-dress-cannot-get-easier-yet-goddess-like' dress that's shibori dyed in 100% cotton mulmul. Tie -up at one shoulder, no need for a bra or keeping that core tight all day and two deep pockets ;)
There's really nothing more you can ask for.
Paired with some vintage and some random silver nick nacks I've accrued over the years and white sneakers so that i can comfortably walk all day at art fair ❤️
This is a dress i know I'll wear all my life (like all my other kharakapas pieces I've had from over the years).
