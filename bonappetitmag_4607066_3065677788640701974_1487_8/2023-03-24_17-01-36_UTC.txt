Growing up, fasting was pretty dull for @zaynab_issa—mostly because it was harder to fill the time. The Weekdays offered a busy-ish schedule that made things easier (school, long naps) until it was time to break fast for iftar. On weekends, she could sleep until noon, but then what? That’s where the Food Network came into play.

Shows like Guy Fieri’s “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,” Rachel Ray’s “30 Minute Meals,” and culinary queen Ina Garten’s “Barefoot Contessa” not only offered a productive timepass but the hosts shared advanced techniques and processes that 10-year-old Zaynab absorbed like a sponge: “When it came time to start preparing for iftar with my family, I could take the techniques I had learned and apply them.”

Eventually, the techniques and dishes Zaynab learned from watching the Food Network started inspiring her own experimentations with different cuisines. And now she sets the table with her own inspired additions alongside classics like rich Karak Chai and fluffy, crispy Mandazi (Mahamri).
