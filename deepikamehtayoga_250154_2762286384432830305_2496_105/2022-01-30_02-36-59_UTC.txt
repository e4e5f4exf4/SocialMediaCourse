Hello you beautiful Goddess out there ,
Today from the bottom of my heart 
I want to say that I feel and empathise with every one of you ,
The ones who are the vulnerable/ nurturing kinds who love to give ,
The Queens who own and are unapologetic about their kingdom , yet somewhere deep down crave the communion of another ..
The messy ones who have their s$<#% all over the place ,
The stable ones who have their S%#% all together but miss the freedom of being messy ..
The lost ones ,
The ones who need to nurture their inner child but have to look after their actual child ! 
The ones who give ,
The ones you take ..
The ones who let go,
The ones who hold on ..
I see you ,
I hear you ,
I feel you ..
Coz i am all of these …
Just like You ❤️🔥🌙 👑#aahthesedamnhormones🌊🌙

A bit embarrassed to share my raw stream of consciousness but in my attempt to be more real I felt like putting myself out there ❤️
