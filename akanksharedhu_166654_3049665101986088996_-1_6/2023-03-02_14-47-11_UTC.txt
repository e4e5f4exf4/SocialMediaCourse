The other kind of dance I like showing up for. 
Over & over again :)
The 1st day of my birthday month got hijacked by mind numbing period pains but when i finally came to it and gathered my nervous system back together and sat with myself here's what came up.
Message for the month is one of patience. Even though i like to believe that i am mostly a very patient person sometimes i do give into being in a hurry towards things that need to take their time to unfold.
And my intention for this month is to keep inviting my shadow to show up and chill in bright light with me because that's just the work i happened to be indulging in right now. 
Like i said. The kind of dance i like to keep showing up for.
But also, the dance of mama nature herself ❤️
