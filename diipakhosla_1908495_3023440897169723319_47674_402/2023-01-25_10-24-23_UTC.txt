This is for all the mothers who get asked the question “why aren’t you with your kid?” whenever we’re on a business trip or need to do things to better ourselves or take care of ourselves the way we take care of our kids. 

I get asked this question the most when I’m on trips without Dua but would it be the same if I was a man? 
I am first and foremost a mother to Dua, but I wonder, how would Dua feel if I sidelined my passions because of this very gendered expectation we only place on women?

The reality is, it’s so difficult being away from my daughter and she’s never not on my mind. Feeling this deep emotion, however, doesn’t take away from the fact that I am also a very ambitious and hardworking woman who loves building my own legacy that Dua can one day be proud of. 

We can experience both emotions without disregarding the other and we can cherish our roles as mothers and still pursue other passions. But ultimately this is a choice, and it is mine to make. 

I respect mothers that make the choices that most resonate with their values, and this does not have to be the same choice as mine. 
My wish is that we all respect mothers and the choices we make without jumping to label anyone as a “bad mother” when we never know the full story. 

I know Dua is having so much fun with her Dad, and this time they have together is also valuable for both of them. I can’t wait to see them both very soon! ❤️
