A Butterfly Riddle by Jaykay Heart @jaykayheart 

Right from the title it has my heart and mind I was curious to solve the riddle and there was no stopping as I perused the book it was a complete page turner thriller. It was fun and fast paced. It’s a thriller but quite different from the ones that I have read lately. The story and the characters are very well crafted by the author it’s so descriptive that the visuals automatically play in your mind. 
To give you a little clue before you get on to solve the riddle yourself. The story is of Siddh an interior designer, an introvert personality and has an obsession with blue butterflies. One day he find a mysterious box and that contains a butterfly and a diary and does begins his quest to find the answers of what when where and how did this box reached the doorstep and so does ours. I would love to say a lot more in my excitement but I rather have you ll read it for yourself and enjoy the thrill.
