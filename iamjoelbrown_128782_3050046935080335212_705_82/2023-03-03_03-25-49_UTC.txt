Let me lay it out straight: I once fell for a narcissistic woman, and it wasn't pretty. Don't get me wrong, I'm not throwing that label around carelessly.

Our relationship was a mere blip on the radar, lasting just three months. Thankfully, I had enough know-how in coaching and self-awareness to cut my losses and start healing.

But the poor guy who followed in my footsteps? Let's just say, his experience was a world of hurt. He was left with a hefty bill and a court case to deal with.

The whole ordeal was so traumatic that he actually tracked me down for advice.

Sadly, I've heard countless stories from both men and women in recent years, describing the pain and suffering they endure at the hands of narcissistic partners.

They know they need to leave, but feel powerless and unsure of where to turn.

So I have decided to share my 6 steps that I have supported many of my coaching clients in the past with so they can build their power and confidence back up to move on from this toxic relationship that is draining them.

Again, I don’t think we should label every relationship partner ‘narcissistic’ that doesn’t work out well.

Most are other wound and trauma based patterns that play out in co-dependent relationships.

Sometimes though there are real cases of narcissistic abuse and so if you feel that you are experiencing this and want to leave then you may want to consider some of these steps.

Please share this with anyone you feel is experiencing this and needs to know ways to move forward.

Praying this helps you 🙏🏼❤️

It’s time to break free from the cycle of abuse and reclaim your power.

Leaving a narcissist is necessary for your mental and emotional well-being, personal growth, and the ability to create healthy relationships based on trust and respect.

You deserve better, take the first step towards freedom today.
