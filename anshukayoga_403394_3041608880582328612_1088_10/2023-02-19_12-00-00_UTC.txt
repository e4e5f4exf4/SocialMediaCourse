The only limit is in your mind 👨🏾‍🦳🧑🏽‍🦳❤️

Yoga asanas can be practiced by everyone, there is no age bar as to when you should start and stop practicing this discipline.

It has umpteen benefits for the elders, it helps them to stay physically active and also supports their mental and emotional well-being.

Of course, check contra-indications, with your doctor etc before following the above but I know that your practice can be modified no matter what age you are 🤍
