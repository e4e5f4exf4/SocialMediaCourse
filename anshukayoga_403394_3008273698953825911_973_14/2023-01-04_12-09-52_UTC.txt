This 2023 we are focusing on our wellness. Challenge yourself to inculcate habits that make you better, whatever they may be 💗🙏

Here’s what I will be upto in a snapshot in 2023:

- Soak in the morning sun every morning 🌞
Let the warmth embrace you as you start your day with yourself by yourself

- My Pranayama is my everything 🌬️
Breath work centres you, brings you back to yourself and gets you ready for the day

- Meditate everyday 🧘🏻‍♀️
Start simple with even 5 minutes, work your way up and feel the magic ✨

- Hydrateeee!!!!! 💧
Your water intake truly makes such a big difference in the way you feel 

- Be kinder to myself 💌
The narrative your adopt to talk yourself matters, make sure its a positive one

- Keeping loving myself ❤️
Love truly makes the world go round and it starts with loving yourself first

So, What are you challenge yourself with in 2023? Let me know in your comments and share with everyone you know 🖤
