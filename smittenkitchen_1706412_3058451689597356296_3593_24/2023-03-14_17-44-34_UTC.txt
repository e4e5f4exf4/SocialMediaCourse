I crave a good quiche with a luxe, bronzed finish like clockwork on sleety, chilly days like this. What sets this Quiche Lorraine apart from classic versions is two decadent additions: a heap of caramelized leeks and a rich tang from sour cream in the filling. With a big green salad and a glass of wine, I cannot think of a better Pi(e) Day dinner. // Quiche Lorraine on smittenkitchen.com or linked in profile. In more detail: Go to my profile.
