The traditional Thar Dinner at Jaisalmer is meant to represent the end of a journey but for us …. There’s so much yet to come. 
I successfully managed to surprise Sid with this unforgettable experience with the help of the wonderful team at @suryagarh. 
We celebrated our 7 year anniversary under the stars over incredible food and a little visitor who makes every day together even more special. 
Ps. Don’t miss the last clip with bubs. 
Blessed
