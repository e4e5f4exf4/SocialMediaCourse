Vineyards of LOVE by @iampooja2007 
I am a big sucker for romantic books. A types of ram tic genres are my favourites and vineyards of love right from the title had my heart. To begin with I adored the colourful tree too on the cover. Itâ€™s a quick read and something which is very relatable in todayâ€™s day and hour. The story is of two people obviously Avisha and Gautam itâ€™s their love story in todayâ€™s world with the number of breakups and fear of commitments, reluctance of falling in love or giving love a second chance. All these emotions are a part of their journey and itâ€™s their tale of connection with their baggages. The book starts from falling in love at first sight and the tale continues along with the journey. Itâ€™s a quick read and I would recommend for all mushy lovers there who love to read that are simple and sweet ðŸ’•
