Drop a “Yes” if you are ready to venture with God this year! 🙏🏼

As human beings, we often have this misconception that we can do everything on our own. We feel like we have to be self-sufficient and independent, that relying on anyone else is a sign of weakness.

But the truth is, there are some things in life that we just can't do alone. We need help, guidance, and support.

And that's where God comes in.

When God takes us to a place we can't venture alone, it's not because we're incapable or weak, it's because there's something we need to learn or experience that we can't do on our own.

Maybe it's a lesson in humility, or a chance to develop our faith, or an opportunity to connect with others in a deeper way.

Whatever the reason, we can trust that when God takes us to these places, we're not alone. God is with us every step of the way, guiding us, protecting us, and providing for us.

It's a reminder that we don't have to be self-sufficient, that we can lean on God and on others when we need help.

And that's a lesson that we can all relate to, because no matter how strong or independent we may be, we all need our creator to make sense of our Purpose and direction in this world.
