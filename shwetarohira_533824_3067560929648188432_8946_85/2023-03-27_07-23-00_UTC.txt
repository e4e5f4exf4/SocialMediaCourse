Happy Theatres day to all ❤️ #thatsmygirl my debut theatre play which gave me memories that I will cherish all my life. If somebody will ask me what’s the best thing that ever happened to you hands down I would say this play 🙌 Thanks to @bharatdabholkar @ananthmahadevanofficial @mohanazaad @riicha.goel I had this experience of being on the stage and having the best debut one can ask for ❤️ well I can go on with the emotions I faced from happy to scary all of it but the insta says caption too long. Can share numerous photo but the #photodump also says #morethanenough so on the last note I can just say there moments these memories are much more than I can express 🥳🤩🤗
