Megan Hyatt Miller and I recently released our new book, Mind Your Mindset. ⁠
⁠
The reviews have been phenomenal, but we’ve also received questions from people that are skeptical about the whole idea of “mindset”.⁠
⁠
One question we keep hearing is this: “How can my thoughts hold me back from success?”⁠ It’s a good question, and it’s one I wrestled with for a while as well, so if you’re confused by this, you’re in good company. ⁠
⁠
Here’s how it works.⁠
⁠
As high-achievers, we often have a bias toward action.⁠
This means that when we don’t get the results we want, we focus on changing our behavior⁠. We analyze our routines, our systems, and our processes, trying to find areas for improvement. ⁠
⁠
In other words, we go straight from the problem to finding a strategy.⁠
⁠
Through our research, we’ve identified a missing step: the story we tell ourselves about the problem. ⁠The way we see the problems we face changes the strategies we create.⁠
⁠
This is how “mindset” can impact your success.⁠
⁠
If you don’t take the time to analyze the stories you tell yourself about the problems you face, you risk getting stuck with insufficient strategies that keep you from your goals.⁠ But when you peel back the layers and identify the real problem, you’re left with new strategies that accelerate your progress.⁠
⁠
Want to learn how to analyze your thinking to fast-track your success?⁠ We show you how in our new book, Mind Your Mindset.⁠
