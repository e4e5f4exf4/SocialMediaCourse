Fly away, fly away with me,
To a place where we can just be. 
Where the water is clear and skies are bright,
Where we can see the stars shine through the night ⭐️

A place we can let our heart and soul shine, 
Where we can leave the worldly cage behind. 
A place where we live our dreams, and don’t have to plan, 
Where nothing is more or less than. 

We can use our wings and learn to fly, 
With no one to judge and ask us why. 
We’ll find ourselves as we lose our way, 
Let’s be at a place where our hearts will be free as the winds blowing each day.
