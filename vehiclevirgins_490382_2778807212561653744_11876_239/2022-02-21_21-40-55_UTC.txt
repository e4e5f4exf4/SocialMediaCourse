Leaked photos of the new Ferrari Purosangue SUV! What do you guys think? While the powertrain hasn’t been confirmed, it is POSSIBLE that Ferrari will offer a naturally aspirated V12 from the 812 Superfast. If that’s the case it’s game over. Considering every other luxury SUV has a V8 and the Plaid X is a rocket ship, a V12 would truly set the Rari SUV apart. #ferrari #purosangue
