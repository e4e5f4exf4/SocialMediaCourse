One of my superpowers is that Iâ€™m never surprised life gets hard. 

My mind is conditioned to know that tough stuff happens and that I will fail and be incapable and thatâ€™s 100 ðŸ’¯ NORMAL. 

I expect difficulty and do my best to rise up to meet it as a challenge of my character and commitment and service. 

Sometimes I suck at dealing with struggle but Iâ€™m rarely surprised that I have to deal with it .. and thatâ€™s been an unfair advantage I think. 

Expect it. Deal with it with a good attitude. Stay optimistic and in motion baby and you just get better and better at dealing with it and you find your flow even on the rough patches.
