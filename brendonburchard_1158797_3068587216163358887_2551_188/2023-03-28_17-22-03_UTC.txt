Mom’s birthday today! Nothing in my life was possible without her love, her joy, her compassion, her remarkable resilience through the hardest of times long before I was even born. She’s is the epitome of my famous line “bring the JOY!” She brings joy and love to everyone she meets and I’ve never met someone who enjoys the little things so much. She loves life and I’m so lucky to have that example. She’s met tens of thousands if you at my events so join me in whishun gHappy birthday momma B❤️bisous bisous ❤️❤️
