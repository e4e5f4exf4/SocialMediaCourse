It’s almost impossible to separate work life and home life. When our personal lives suffer because of overwork, our work suffers too—or will eventually. ⁠

Worst of all, burnout breeds cynicism. Thanks to lower productivity, it’s not like overworked employees make any real gains for their sacrifices; rather, it’s all about staying afloat in a dysfunctional work environment. This is a disaster waiting to happen if it hasn’t already. Not only does burnout hurt employees’ professional and personal lives, it breeds the kind of cynicism that sours office culture and harms customer relations. ⁠

When workers think success is zero-sum, and for the company to win, they have to lose, it’s easy to turn septic and spread toxicity through the organization and beyond. When you give your employees time and space to rest, everyone will win.⁠
