As a sixth-generation West Virginian, poet Crystal Good (@cgoodwoman) finds a sense of home in the landscape, among the trees and the 200-million-year-old rocks of the Mountain State. In this guide to enjoying the state's Appalachian culture, Good packs in scenic hikes and plenty to taste: fried whiting on white bread with hot sauce, fluffy biscuits, cabbage soup with hush puppies.
