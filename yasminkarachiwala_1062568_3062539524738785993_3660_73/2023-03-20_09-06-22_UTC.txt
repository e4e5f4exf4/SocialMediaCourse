The mouth is the gateway to the body, and any disease or infection that originates in the oral cavity can have serious consequences on the rest of the body. Research has shown that there is a strong correlation between oral and general health. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain a good oral hygiene in daily life. 

1️⃣ *Brush Twice Daily*: It is recommended to brush at least twice a day for two minutes each. Replace your brush every three to four months or even sooner. It is also advisable to use a soft-bristled brush.

2️⃣ *Rinse your mouth post meals*: Rinsing your mouth with plain water helps remove food residue from your tooth surfaces and any acids from your food or beverage that could soften your enamel.

3️⃣ *Visit your dentist regularly*: Schedule regular dental check-ups and clean-ups with your dentist. Doing so is the best way to ensure good oral health.

Let’s pledge start adding these small steps to our routine, be more sensitive and take charge of our oral health!
