Most of us know about the Gratitude Advantage. Expressing thanks leads to lower stress, better relationships, improved health, and more. But there’s one place we’re unlikely to express gratitude: work.⁠
⁠
Practically speaking, most of us spend more waking time at the office than anywhere else. That means if we expect to use the Gratitude Advantage to our benefit, work is actually the best place to do it. ⁠
⁠
And as a leader, it’s important to remember that people will only go so far in the performance of a duty. They will underperform when they feel underappreciated.⁠
⁠
If you want people’s very best, you have to have their hearts. You can’t demand this or even buy it with a paycheck. Gratitude is the most effective currency for keeping people engaged and performing at their best. That’s true for you and the people you lead.⁠
