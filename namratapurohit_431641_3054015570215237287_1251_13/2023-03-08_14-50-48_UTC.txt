I have no shape or form. Pour me into a jar and I will take that shape, pour me out and I’ll transform to new forms. I am free flowing. 

I am water, I am woman. I shall not be contained, I cannot be stopped! The shape is mine to take, the journey is mine to make. 

Happy woman’s day 💕 and thank you to all the women who support each other and build each other up! And also a big thank you to the men who help us make our way by simply being there for us. 💕⭐️ #HappyWomensDay
