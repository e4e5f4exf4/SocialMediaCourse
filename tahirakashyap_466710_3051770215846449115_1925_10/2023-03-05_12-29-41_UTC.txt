Be more courageous, be more brave...just like our coverstar, Tahira Kashyap Khurrana (@tahirakashyap). The author, writer, and filmmaker is #MoreThanPretty—living her truth, with a desire to tell powerful female-led stories on-screen. “When a story is seen through a woman’s lens, women aren’t treated as decorative props. In their storyline, female characters have agency over their decisions. I believe we bring so much to the fore through the female gaze, and it is extremely essential to have one,” Tahira shares. 

So why not celebrate us, this Women's Day? Be #MoreThanPretty with @mango @mangostores_india.
