The Highway Murders by @authorsourabhmukherjee 
 
I have read books penned by the author in the past and I must say he is one of my few favourite authors when it comes to reading this genre. He can hook you right from the very first page of his book. It’s happened with me in the past and it’s the same feeling right now while I was reading “The Highway Murders”. The book is based on a true story of a psycho killer named M Jaishankar. The story is breathtaking and can be read in a sitting or two but I took my time as the details are gory and I needed my break time from part or part. The author as usual has very very well researched the topic and written the story in a way that it catches your eye and mind from the cover right UPTO the end. It’s a fascinating true story which I would recommend all to read who like this genre it’s got the facts but it still doesn’t sound academic. It’s gruesome but very intriguing. So happy thrill reading this weekend
