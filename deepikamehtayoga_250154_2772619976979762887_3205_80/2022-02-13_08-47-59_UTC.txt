4 drills to work on jump backs and bent arm strength in the Ashtanga practice.
My biggest weakness is the bent arm strength and so some of these are pretty hard for me as well.
Growth is when you acknowledge your weakness and work on it.💪🏽

1️⃣Push ups : 10 reps , 3/4 sets

2️⃣Face plant Lolasana 🤣: 10 reps ,3/4 sets
