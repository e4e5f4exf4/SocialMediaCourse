October in New York. The BEST trip. From Kelly & Ryan, a holiday shoot day in Brooklyn (more soon) and celebrating our Pumpkin Smash candle. I feel so lucky to get to do these things and itâ€™s really because of you all ðŸ§¡ SO FREAKING excited for the the coming months and year. So many new things to share!! Thank you for the outpour of support! I say this all the time, but you really feel like family. And while the candle might be sold out now, itâ€™s back in November, just in time for the holidays ðŸ¦ƒ
