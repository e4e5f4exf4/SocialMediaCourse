Caramel Butter Cake with Fudgy Chocolate Frosting. I LOVE an “old school” dessert. As in the ones our grandmas would make. Grandmas have the BEST recipes, you know? This is beyond good. Fudge like chocolate frosting + brown sugar caramel icing really just make it freaking delicious (: Happy Weekend!
