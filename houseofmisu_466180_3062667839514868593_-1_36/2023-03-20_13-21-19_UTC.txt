Someone once asked me if I had a choice , would I choose to be a woman. I didnâ€™t even have to think about it - my answer was a resounding YES. As a woman I am powerful wether or not you can see it. 
And in that knowledge I find courage to take on the world. 
A proud woman supporting other like myself. @shopanaya.usa is a proud women run brand which revels in its Indian roots , bringing to life beautiful garments using textiles and prints from the homeland. Everything is designed in Boston hand made with love in Mumbai. Their collections have a limited number of pieces in order to have less waste. A beautiful brand which celebrates the beauty of being a woman. #misufashion #indianwear #misubride #indianfashion #indianwedding #lengha #ad
