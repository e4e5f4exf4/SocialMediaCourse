Brave little warriors,
Fighting battles bigger than themselves, 
But their strength and courage,
Shines brighter than any star in the sky. 

Today and always, we stand with our little fighters.
 
Every child deserves a chance to grow up and fulfil their dreams. 

Let's unite on International Childhood Cancer Day to raise awareness and support the little fighters. 

Together, we can make a difference and give hope to children fighting cancer.
