Happy 2023 from our frozen but happy faces ðŸ¥°

Took a few days off to start the new year by making the most of our vacation. But I have a lot to share from the last leg of our trip with you, before I go back home this weekend for a very exciting month ahead! Hope youâ€™re all having the best start to the new year âœ¨
