A story of Faith & Miracles by Ravi Valluri @rv_spirits2spirituality 

The book is an autobiographical account of the author which just like the title suggest is a story of faith and miracles right from the day the author was to be born. I have known the author for a while and have read other books penned by him but was unaware of his journey (personal journey). Had a wide view of his professional journey and the to an extent about his spiritual journey but got a macro view how faith, prayers and miracles have guided him right from the start and how they have made him professionally and personally achieve much more. I wonâ€™t spoil the book by letting out the details but trust me this book will make you believe in faith and miracle. It will force you to see the daily life routine life beautifully and it will restore your faith in surrendering to the divine powers
