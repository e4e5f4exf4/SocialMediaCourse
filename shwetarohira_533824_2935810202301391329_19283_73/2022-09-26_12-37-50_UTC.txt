Withered to Blossom (A Reverie in Dark Times) by Dhachu @d.h.a.c.h.u 

It’s a book you would want to own it and keep it in the library. Every poem was profound. The thoughts in each one of them would stop me in tracks and would have me pondering over those words and lost in my thoughts. As the thoughts expressed by the author and the subject touched are so deep but are expressed splendidly through her poetry. I won’t write too much here since I think it’s best to just experience this book on its own but I would like to quote my favourite from her collection of poems 
  SHE 
She gives and does everything for everyone’s best 
Wishing for one day her soul and body could have a rest 
Where she be appreciated for things, she did not have any regret 
Words were never enough to praise her worth, cause she doesn’t fret. 

Start of time till now, she went through hardships in silence 
She shouldered and burdened your problems and talks but no one there to listen to her laments, 
Her bones were crushed and her heart was damaged 
But she’s a Shero, curtailed behind nameless heroes, she never backed. 

She faced things head - on, was afraid but brave 
And was stamped in each step, she didn’t cave,
Her name is not her identity, nothing is her property, they haze
They blame her for the happenings, as she struggles to cross life’s maze. 

Remember that she is the creator of all things,
Without her there cease to exist these human beings,
 She deserves the world to be treated like the queen she is even without her crown.
This world won’t be ready to face her anger and no one can drag her down. 

It’s a beautiful book of poetry, which can be enjoyed by beginner readers too as it’s in simple words and harmonious rhymes which makes its a quick and interesting read.
