It's fun to dance around on an empty dark beach with your tea bags hanging out. Under the stars with the moon just coming up and salt suspended in the air. A doggo was on lookout OBVS.
Had it been warmer a skinny dip would've been in the cards too but not in Jan, not for me atleast (although I type this as someone who has grown fond of her 2 minute cold showers in the peak of winters, something i believed i would NEVER even try)
The owner of the beach huts i was staying at kept asking to see the pics I'd told him i was taking of the moon. He didn't realise i take precedence over the moon on most days ðŸŒ’
( Edit: the beach was actually pitch black. It's the camera that's caught all this light )
