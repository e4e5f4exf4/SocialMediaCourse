10 random images of the past 10 years. 

With 2023, I welcome the new but there’s so much I’m grateful for staying the same. 

My desire to empower my community, to stay connected to my roots, to grow with my family and the individuals that help me achieve my wildest dreams, are all things I want to take with me. 

The changes that have entered my life over the past couple of years, like becoming a mother to the most beautiful vibrant daughter and launching inde wild as an act of honoring all that my mother has taught me, and all the opportunities and challenges I’ve embraced, remind me that the change that is yet to come will also be filled with beauty. 

I can’t wait for what 2023 has in store for all of us. 🫶🏽
