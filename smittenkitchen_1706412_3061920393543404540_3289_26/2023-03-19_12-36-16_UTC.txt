Everyone has an opinion on how to make perfectly scrambled eggs and this is mine: I like a ribbony heap that comes from a push-pause motion in the pan, forming small and larger bites that are never, ever overcooked or rubbery. Heap it on a thick piece of toast with soft cheese and chives and enjoy it with an exceedingly strong cup of coffee on the side.
