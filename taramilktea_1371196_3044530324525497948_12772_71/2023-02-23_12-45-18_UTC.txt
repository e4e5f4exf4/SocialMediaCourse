For a wonderfully unique stay in Tokyo, look no further than @tokyostationhotel. This hotel is filled with so much history and charm, you could walk itâ€™s halls and have walked entire length of Tokyo Tower while reading about the hotel throughout the years on your way. ðŸ—¼

Beyond the award-winning breakfast buffet, you'll find a few more charms, such as the ability to people-watch commuters below at Tokyo Station or watch the trains pass by from your dinner table. Be sure to save this hotel for a special occasion or at least stop by for their beautiful high tea. ðŸ«– #TokyoStationHotel #Tokyo ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ
