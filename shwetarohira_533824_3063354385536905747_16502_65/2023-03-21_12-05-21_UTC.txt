Never Ask for a Kiss by @abhishekbhaskarvichare 

The title and the cover lured me@into reading the love story and I have to say that the author has very brilliantly touched a very important topic and narrated it in a light manner. It highlights the subject of Consent. A topic which is very realistic and important part of every relationship well to give you a little snippet itâ€™s a story of Anuj and Ruchi and what transpires later when Anuj kisses her without her consent. What fate has in store what transpires later when Ruchi disapproves and also decides to discontinue their relations and expresses her desire never to see him again. Arya Khanna, RU his aunt enters as a fairy god mother for Anuj and helps him Coe with it but she also helps him understand relationships as well as to mend things with Ruchi because he truly loves her and keeps pursuing her. It may seem like a simple love story but you in for a surprise that you never expected. The language and narrative style of the author makes the book fast paced and can be read by all I would strongly recommend this book to young adults and also to readers who love this genre 

Happy Reading :)
