Our experience with Reelabs has been extremely pleasing.

To give you a gist of what ReeLabs is, It is for starters the only bank in the country that has the permission to preserve Placental Stem Cells. 

The Placental Stem Cells are the richest source of stem cells and should the need arise they can help the baby in future for medical procedures. 

ReeLabs is based in Mumbai and is headed by professional doctors and scientists from India and Ukraine! 

It has been a great journey for us with @reelabs
