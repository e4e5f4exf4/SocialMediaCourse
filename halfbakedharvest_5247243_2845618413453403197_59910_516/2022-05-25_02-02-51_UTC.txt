Crispy BBQ Salmon Tacos with Avocado Mango Salsa and Jalapeño Cream. I love a taco, but there is something extra special about these. the fish is spicy and delicious, the mango-avocado salsa completes them, but the jalapeño cream and hard taco shells are the game changers. beyond good. recipe in profile.
