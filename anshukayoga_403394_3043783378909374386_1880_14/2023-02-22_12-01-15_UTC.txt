On wednesdays we begin with🧘‍♀️ 

Something that has helped me the most during my pregnancy has been yoga, I have spoken openly multiple times about how my pregnancy hasn’t been the easiest and most fun compared to some lucky mamas. But there’s also a flip side to it all, While there are days(everyday) where I feel sooo sick, there are also days where my body makes me feel so strong, empowered, excited for what is to come. Gosh I have my baby growing in me(still can’t believeeeee it ) I feel it now everyday. 
Our bodies are amazing! 
There are good days, there are bad days and then the realllyy bad days 🤦🏻‍♀️ and I feel that Yoga has really helped me get my energy back to get through it all, making me feel a little like myself again. Funnily me being the restless person I am I always kept thinking that yoga is not for me. And now here I am waiting for my Monday/wed/Fridays waiting to get to class. I’m ready to 🕺🏻 after 😂
My teacher Piyush makes me start and end my end my class holding my stomach and thanking my body for always supporting me. Which is a great reminder to have that gratitude and love for your body for what it’s doing for you. 

To growing stronger everyday ♥️ and the biggest thank you to @anshukayoga
