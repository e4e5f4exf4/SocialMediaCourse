Pull Apart Italian Sub Sliders. SO GOOD. Super easy and wow, holy freaking delicious. Cheesy on the inside, golden and toasted outside, with the best roasted red pepper sauce in the middle + garlic butter topping. All the elements of a good Italian style sub layered into cute sliders (: Link in profile.
