An imperishable PROMISE by @sarathisabyasachi 

I love reading love stories as they all are unique in their own way. It’s my favourite genre and the cover just like it’s title promises unique love story. The story is of Raj, Deepak, and  Kashish but not the usual triangle. The book has some fresh air and as you read and the story keeps unfolding it will amaze you. It’s a story not only about life but also about Afterlife. I liked the narration style of the author ( here would like to bring a little thing to your notice that avid readers don’t go on the language just read and flow with the story and the characters. Dwell deep into that) for the beginners it’s apt will make you fall in love with reading too as it’s a short book with a powerful story which you can read at one go or in a couple of sittings. I thoroughly enjoyed the emotional grip that the author has on you with his story and I PROMISE you will too
