Om Shanti 🙏🏽 Our dearest Dadima left us some time back. We grieved silently and frankly I was not ready to share it here until now. 

Just wanted to come out here and thank you all for the amount of love you showered upon her. She saw it, she read it, she devoured it. YOUR COMMENTS MADE HER SMILE. You all were her absolute favorite and she would always ask me ‘Taari badi friends kem che’… 

The timing was uncanny. It was almost like she waited just to see her great grandson and hold him. She waited to see that I was doing okay in my new role as a mother. And then she left us in the most serene & peaceful way and there is no other way I could imagine for someone as spiritual & positive as her.

In my heart forever…. 💕
