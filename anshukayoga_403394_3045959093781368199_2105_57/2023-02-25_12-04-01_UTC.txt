It was an honour to be on stage and spread some love and knowledge about Yoga and itâ€™s wonders, with our societyâ€™s true heroes at the AMCON event.

Our doctors ðŸ¥¼ have proved time and again that they are our societyâ€™s true heroes. But the fact is that these heroes also live a very stressful life with very little time for themselves and their health and wellness.

At AMCON, I got the opportunity to speak about how Yoga can be incorporated in the daily busy schedules of a doctors life, which contributes to their wellness and mental health.

A special thank you to Dr. Nilima Bharmare @Adv_dr_nilima and Dr. Hemant Dugad !
