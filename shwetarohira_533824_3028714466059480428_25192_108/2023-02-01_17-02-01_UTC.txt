When Lips are Silent penned by @shreyashi_bhattacharya_  is not so regular romance novella. Itâ€™s a story of Shreya and Rishabh and their budding romance since school days. The romance in this book felt like an Insta love and went to quick for me. The narration of the author gave me a feeling as if the protagonist Shreya was sharing her tale with me over a cup of coffee which makes the read quick and pacy. I enjoyed the read and what I liked about the book is that though itâ€™s a piece of fiction a lot of parts and emotions felt relatable. Itâ€™s a heart warming story and a tear jerker book. I want to tell you more but I am not telling you about their story. All I am saying is that I loved it and my lips are silent ðŸ˜Š
