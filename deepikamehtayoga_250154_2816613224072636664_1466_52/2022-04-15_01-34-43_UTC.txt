This was me after I got an amazing cranio session , so a lil disheveled but my heart felt so full ❤️

So because so many of you are asking me , Cranio sacral therapy which is what I got is a very subtle hands on technique of adjusting the spine and the CNS .. the technique is very subtle but you can really feel a deep sense of well-being after .❤️🙏🏻
